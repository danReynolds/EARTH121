# Science of Geology

**geo** = Earth, **logos** = discourse.

**outcrops** = bedrock exposed at the surface.

**Physical geology** = Earth's materials and processes.

**Historial geology** = Earth's development through time.

**Sir William Logan** = head of geologic survey in Canada in 1842. Examined rocks in Nova Scotia. Drew attention to Canada's mineral wealth. Wrote extensive journals/maps.

**Catastrophism** = developed in the mid-seventeenth century by James Ussher, a scholar of the Bible who declared that the Earth was created in 4004 BCE. Catastrophists believed that Earth's landscape had been shaped primarily by major catastrophes. Mountains and canyons were created by major worldwide disasters produced by unknown causes that no longer operate. This was an attempt to fit the rates of Earth processes to the then-current ideas on the age of Earth.

**Uniformitarianism** = Late 18th century, James Hutton published Theory of the Earth. Principle states that *physical, chemical, and biologic laws that operate today have also operated in the geologic past*. The forces that shape our world today have been operating for a long time. The present is the key to the past.

Forces that appear small could, over time, produce effects that were just as great as those supposed to have resulted from catastrophic events.

This means accepting that the Earth is very old.

**Relative Dating** = events are placed in their proper sequence or order without knowing age in years.

**Law of Superposition** = in layers of sedimentary rocks or lava flows, the youngest layer is on top and the oldest is on the bottom, generally.

**Principle of Fossil Succession** = fossil organism succeed one another in a definite and determinable order. Time spans can be recognized by fossil content.

**Nebular Theory** = bodies of our solar system evolved from an enormous rotating cloud called the solar nebular, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.

**Core** = dense, iron-rich and nickel alloy.

**Crust** = thin, primitive.

**Mantle** = largest, located between the core and the crust, dominated by iron, mag, oxy. 82% of Earth's volume is in mantle. Solid rocky shell extends to a depth of 2900km.

Chemicals escaped interior, slowly formed atmosphere.

**Continental Drift** = proposed by Wegener in early 20th century, idea that continents moved about the face of the planet. Followed from his work on The Origin of Continents and Oceans.

50 years later, confirmed and known as **plate techtonics**.

**Pangaea** = single continent suggested by Wegener. Seaward edge of **continental shelf**, gently sloping material extending from the shores, used to fit them together. Mountain belts also fit together spanning continents.

**Lithosphere** = sphere of rock that consists of the crust and the uppermost brittle part of the mantle. Broken into smaller units called plates, mobile and continually changing shape and size over time. 7 major lithospheric plates are recognized. Move toward eachother at 5cm a year.

**Mantle Convection** = movement of plates driven by unequal distribution of heat within the Earth, which moves slowly upward, and serves as the planet's internal convection system.

Cooler, denser sections of lithosphere descend back into the mantle.

Plates have 3 distinct boundaries:

1. Divergent Boundaries: plate spreading creates new sea floors.

2. Convergent Boundaries: plates move together, oceanic lithosphere descend to the mantle, or collision results in mountains. When collide, one goes up, other down in a process called **subduction**.

3. Transform Fault Boundaries: plates slide past eachother without the production or destruction of lithosphere.

**Asthenosphere** = beneath the lithosphere, in the upper mantle, weaker, softer because the rock is near its melting point. Lithosphere is detached from Asthenosphere, allowing it to move separately.

**Mesosphere** = lower mantle, stronger rocks.

**Inner and Outer Core** = outer is a liquid layer 2270km thick, it is the convective flow of metallic iron within this zone that generates Earth's magnetic field.

Inner is a sphere with radius 1216km, hotter but stronger because of intense pressure, behaves like a solid.

**Hydrosphere** = dynamic mass of water, evaporating from the oceans to the atmosphere, precipitating on the land. Also includes the fresh water found underground and in streams, lakes, glaciers.

**Atmosphere** = thin, tenuous, 50% below 5.6km altitude. 90% within 16km. By comparison, Lithosphere averages 100km in thickness.

**Biosphere** = all life on Earth.

**Geosphere** = The crust, mantle and core.

**Shields** = extensive and relatively flat expanses composed largely of crystalline, granite-like rocks. Some shield-rock is aged over 4 billion years.

**Ocean Basisns** have topographic features, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East-Pacific Rise, which forms a continuous belt that winds around the globe. Ridges consist of layers of volcanic rock that has been fractured and uplifted.

**Continental slopes** = at edges of continents are shelves and steeper slopes. 

The ocean floor also has depressions exceeding 11km. These are called **trenches**.

**Energy sources** = the Sun, Earth's interior.

**Rock cycle** = cycle that involves the processes by which one type of rock changes to another, be it igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic.

**Igneous Rock** = cooled magnma.

**Sedimentary Rock** = small particles of sediment undergo *lithification*, a conversion to rock when compacted by the weight of overlaying layers or when cemented as percolating water fills the spaces between particles with mineral matter.

**Metamorphic Rock** = rock formed by extreme pressures and heat. Sedimentary rock buried deep within the Earth undergoes heavy pressure that can result in this change.
