# Crustal deformation

Deformation changes the character of the rocks:

* Undeformed (unstrained): horizontal beds, spherical sand grains, no folds or faults.
* Deformed (strained): Tilted beds, metamorphic alteration, folding and faulting

## Deformation

* Displacement - a change in **location**.
* Rotation - a change in **orientation**.
* Distortion - a change in **shape**.

* Force: tends to put stationary objects in motion, or changes the motion of moving bodies
* Stress: force that deforms rock over an area
* Strain: visible response to stress, changes in the shape or size of a rock caused by stress.

## Strain

Strain is the change in **shape** caused by deformation.
There are several types of strain:

1. Stretching: pulling apart
2. Shortening: squeezing together
3. Shearing: sliding past

## Brittle vs Ductile Deformation

There are two major deformation types, **brittle** and **ductile**.

The type of deformation depends on:

* Temperature
* Pressure
* Deformation Rate
* Composition

**Brittle Deformation** rocks break by **fracturing**, brittle deformation occurs in the upper crust under lower temperatures and pressures.

**Ductile Deformation** rocks deform by **flowing and folding**. Occurs at higher pressure and temperature deeper in the crust.

There is a transition from brittle to ductile deformation at 10-15km.

## Brittle vs. Ductile Deformation

**Temperature = Low vs high**
**Pressure = Low vs High**
**Time = Fast vs Slow**
**Composition = Strong vs Weak**

## Earth's crust

**Lithosphere (crust + upper mantle)**: about 100-250km thick, relatively rigid.

**Asthenosphere (upper mantle, below litho)**: about 200km thick, relatively ductile and easily deformed.

## Deformation - Composition

General ranking of lithology according to strength, based on tests at room temperature and low confiing pressure:

Strongest / competent:

* Quartzite
* Granite
* Quartz-cemented sandstone
* Basalt

Intermediate strength / competency:

* Limestone
* Calcite-cemented sandstone
* Schist
* Marble

Weak / incompetent:

* Shale / mudstone
* Anhydrite
* Salt

## Causes of Deformation

**Strain** is the result of deformation, caused by force acting on rock, called stress.

**Stress** is the force applied across an area.

## Types of Stress

* **Differential Stress**: stress is applied unequally from different directions
* **Compressional Stress**: stress shortens a rock body
* **Tensional Stress**: stress elongates a rock body
* **Shear Stress**: stress results in shearing moving in opposite directions

## Fault Terminology
These are all **dip/slip** faults with an angle associated:

Normal Fault: for a dip-slip fault, with brittle fracturing, it has the head wall slide down.

Reverse Fault: reverse to gravity, moves up.

Thrust Fault: if dip, so angle it dipped, is less than 45%, moving up and over the adjacent piece, making it vertically higher and horizontally thinner.

Then there are **strike/slip** faults:

Move past one another horizontally, not vertically. There are right and left laterals. If you stand on one, looking at the other, then if the one you're looking at is to the right of the current one you're standing on, then right lateral, else left lateral.

## Fold Terminology

**Limbs** = refer to the sides of a fold
**Axis** = a line drawn down the crest of the fold.
**Plungle** = a fold axis inclined at an angle (complex folding), plane is not perpendicular, the fold is tilted.
**Axial plane** = an imaginary surface that divides a fold as symmetrically as possible.

axial plane is vertical, cutting the fold in half horizontally. The left and right side are ideally symmetric.

**Syncline** sink, trough, that has material gathering at the sink's bottom, growing layers of strata filling it up, so the youngest are at the top of the trough.

**Anticline** dome, anthill-shape, that has material eroding off of its top, so the oldest is at the top of the dome, and its limbs have the youngest that is eroded from the top.

Big ridges in the landscape because of the deformation that has pushed limbs up or down.
