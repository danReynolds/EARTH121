# Geologic time

Discovering the magnitude of the Earth's past was a momentous development in the history of humanity.

This discovery forever altered our perception of ourselves within nature and the universe.

Understanding time permits assigning an age to:

Rocks, fossils, geologic structures, landscapes, tectonic events.

Why is time important in Earth Science?

Age, Rates of geological processes, risk/hazards aspects, correlation.

Are there gaps in the Rock Record?

**Unconformity** = a gap in time, due to non-deposition or erosion. We don't have info about this part of time because the rocks were missing.

## Unconformities

Earth history is recorded in strata. Missing strata is missing history.

The Grand Canyon has thick layers of strata, numerous gaps, partial record of geological history.

## Types of Unconformity

**Angular Unconformity** = an unconformity where horizontally parallel strata of sedimentary rock are deposited on tilted and eroded layers of sedimentary rock.

**Disconformity** = an unconformity between parallel layers of sedimentary rock.

**Nonconformity** = an unconformity where sedimentary rocks lie above eroded metamorphic or igneous rock.
