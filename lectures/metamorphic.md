## Metamorphic Grade

low-grade/fine-grained to high-grade/coarse-grained:

slate->phyllite->schist->gneiss->granulite

## 7 Metamorphic Environments

1. Contact: heat from magma invading host rock. High temperature, heating by plutonic intrusion.

2. Burial: burial of sediment in sedimentary basin.

3. Dynamic: Breakage of rock by shearing at a fault zone.

4. Hydrothermal: Alteration by hot, chemically aggressive, leaching water.

5. Subduction: Trenches and accretionary prisms, high pressure alteration in subduction zones.

6. Dynamothermal: Tectonic collisions deform huge mobile belts. After collission, a sediment near the surface is now 15km beneath the Earth's surface. High pressure and temperature alteration due to orogenesis.

7. Shock: Rarely, Earth is struck by a comet or asteroid.
