# Midterm 2

On 6,7,8,20,9, guest lectures

Advantages of dams:

renewable resource
relatively inexpensive
flexible, can put one in, remove it,
open one up etc.
non-polluting


Disadvantages:

Limited by high flows. If high flows convert to low
flows, not producing much energy.

## Two Broad Classes of Natural resources

1. Renewable:

* Perpetual: Sun, wind, tidal, geothermal
* Potentially Renewable: Water, soil, plants, animals

2. Non-renewable:

* Fossil fuels: coal, oil, natural gas, tar sand, oil shale
* Metallic and nonmetallic minerals: some are potentially re-usable

Wood followed by coal formed the basis of past energy resources, now we have hydro, oil, natural gas and nuclear.

1. Crude Oil:

* Automobiles
* Easily transported
* International trade import
* Depletion

2. Coal:

* Very large world supplies
* Variations in properties
* Bulky Transportation
* Mining conditions
* Environment problems

3. Natural gas:

* Efficient, versatile, burns cleanly
* Flows easily and cheaply by pipeline
* LNG (storage/transportation)

Alternative non-renewable energy sources:

## Oil shale and tar sands

* Technology and price of oil
* Large world reserves
* Expensive infrastructure investments
* Substantial environmental costs

## Nuclear

* High costs, safety concerns
* Lack of safe storage for radioactive waste
* Potential terrorist targets
* Tremendous Potential

## Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists (CSPG)

Mission is to advance the professions of the energy geosciences as it applies to geology, foster the scientific, technical learning and professional development of its members, promote the awareness of the profession to industry and the public.

## Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC)

Represents the interests of the Canadian mineral exploration and development industry. Established in 1932 in response to a proposed government regulation that threatened the livelihood of Ontario prospectors.

## Aggregates

A *non-renewable* resource that consists of any combination *sand, gravel, or crushed stone bedrock*.

* **Economic Importance** = employment and billions in the construction industry, glass and glass products industry, pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing industry

* **Social Importance** = Future growth with public demand and interesting population (new roads, schools, businesses)

* **Environmental Uses** = sand used for filtering in drinking water and waste systems, gravel used for spawning beds for fish habitat, limestone used to improve agricultural soil.
