# Geologic time

Discovering the magnitude of the Earth's past was a momentous development in the history of humanity.

This discovery forever altered our perception of ourselves within nature and the universe.

Understanding time permits assigning an age to:

Rocks, fossils, geologic structures, landscapes, tectonic events.

Why is time important in Earth Science?

Age, Rates of geological processes, risk/hazards aspects, correlation.

Are there gaps in the Rock Record?

**Unconformity** = a gap in time, due to non-deposition or erosion. We don't have info about this part of time because the rocks were missing.

## Unconformities

Earth history is recorded in strata. Missing strata is missing history.

The Grand Canyon has thick layers of strata, numerous gaps, partial record of geological history.

## Types of Unconformity

**Angular Unconformity** = an unconformity where horizontally parallel strata of sedimentary rock are deposited on tilted and eroded layers of sedimentary rock.

**Disconformity** = an unconformity between parallel layers of sedimentary rock.

**Nonconformity** = an unconformity where sedimentary rocks lie above eroded metamorphic or igneous rock.

**Geologic column** = a composite stratigraphic column can be constructed as an assemblage from incomplete sections across the globe. It brackets almost the entirety of Earth's history.

The composite column is divided into time blocks:

Eons, eras, periods, epochs.

Life started to appear about 3.8 billion years ago. 700 million years ago we got multicellular life, then 542 million years ago we got the appearance of hard shells.

## Ways of Determining age

There are 2 ways of dating geologic materials:

1. Relative Dating: based upon order of formation.

Relative dating principles:

* **Superposition**: In an undisturbed succession of sedimentary rock layers, the youngest layer is at the top.

* **Fossil Succession**: Fossils at the bottom of a stratal sequence are older than those on top.

William *Strata* Smith recognized that fossils could help differentiate similar-looking limestones.

* **Original horizontality**: Sediment is deposited in horizontal layers: tilting of layers occurs after lithification.

* **Lateral continuity**: sediment extends laterally in all directions until it thins and pinches out or terminates against the edge of the depositional basin.

* **Cross-Cutting Relationships**: Igneous rock or intrusion or fault must be younger than rocks it intrudes or displaces.

If rock D forces half of CBA down, so that now the left and right side of CBA are offset, we can look at that and know that D must have formed after CBA, since it pushed the right side down.

* Inclusions of one rock contained within another layer of rock are older than the rock which contains the inclusions. If I include you, I must have formed around you, and therefore you formed first.

2. Numeric Dating: Actual number of years since an event.
