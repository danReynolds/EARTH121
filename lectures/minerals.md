Silicon

A non-metalllic element with atomic number 14 and the chemical symbol of Si. Occurs extensively in the Earthâ€™s crust in silica and silicates. Present in sand and glass. Used in a wide variety of electronic and computer components (i.e. LED, power supplies, photodetectors).

Silica

The compound SiO2 which in its crystalline form is the mineral quartz.

Silicate

Any mineral that contains the elements silicon and oxygen bonded together as the SiO4 molecule, typically with additional elements (typically iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium, aluminum, and calcium). Most rock-forming minerals are these

A mineral is:

* naturally occurring
* inorganic
* solid
* ordered internal molecular structure
* definite chemical composition

## Physical Properties of minerals

Color, Crystal Habit (Shape), Hardness, Specific Gravity, Cleavage/Fracture,
Streak, Lustre, Other special properties like magnetism, reaction of HCL, taste, smell.

## Elemental composition

The Internal Earth is 30% oxygen, 35% iron, 15% silicion and 13% magnesium.

The Earth's crust is 28% silicon, 46% oxygen and 8% aluminum.

Dolomite and Calcite look very similar, but with HCL, the calcite will react, not the dolomite until it is a fine powder.

Salt/halite has a taste.
