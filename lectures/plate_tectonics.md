## Alfred Wegener

German meteorologist, polar explorer. Wrote the Origins of the Continents and Oceans in 1915.

Hypothesized a former super-continent, **Pangaea** used to exist.

He suggested that land masses slowly move, **continental drift**.

## Scientific Revolution of 1960

Earth continually changes, continents move, split apart and recombine. Ocean basins open and close. His hypothesis was met with skepticism.

Evidence for his hypothesis included: fossil remains of shared creatures from South America and Africa, as well as between other continents.

Mountain belts that line up with eachother.

He did not see the acceptance of his work in his lifetime, because he could not explain how or why continents **form**.

Sonar was later invented and allowed for sea-floor mapping.

Oceanographers discovered that a mid-ocean mountain range runs through every ocean. Deep-ocean trenches occur near volcanic island chains. Submarine volcanoes poke up from the ocean floor. Huge fracture zones segment the mid-ocean ridge.

All of these observations are explained by **plate tectonics**.

Harry Hess first made his Theory of Seafloor-Spreading. Magma erupts at the mid-ocean ridges, new crust moves away from the ridges, gathering sediment, at trenches, the sea-floor sinks back into the mantle.

Continents therefore move **apart** as sea-floor spreading occurs and move **together** as the sea-floor sinks back into the mantle.

In 1963, Lawrence Morley, Fred Vine and D. Matthews tied the discovery of magnetic stripes in the ocean crust near ridges to Hess' concept of seafloor spreading.

Geomagnetic reversals are recorded in the ocean crust. Magnetic polarity reversals are imprinted in seafloor rock as the sea floor continues to spread.

The width of the magnetic anomaly stripes is related to the spreading rate.

Tuzo Wilson then discovered **Transform Faults**. They connect the ocean ridge system and divide Earth's lithosphere into rigid plates. Big plates beneath continents that join together.

## Plate Tectonics Theory

Collection of a variety of ideas that explain the observed motion of Earth's lithosphere through the mechanisms of subduction and seafloor spreading. Subduction is when two convergent plates meet and one goes under the other, sinking back into the mantle. Sea-floor spreading are divergent plates which expose new rock from mantle.

The lithosphere is broken into moving plates. Overlies a weaker region in the mantle called the asthenosphere.

Mantle is transferred to the surface and back down again.

Plates are dragged atop the convection currents in the mantle.

## Earth's Interior

### Core

Iron-rich sphere with a radius of 3500km. Outer core is liquid, inner core is solid.

### Mantle

Solid rock, convection below ~100km. Lithosphere rigid crust and Upper mantle. Asthenosphere softer, flows in Upper Mantle.

### Crust

Upper part of tectonic plate, continental granite and oceanic basalt.
