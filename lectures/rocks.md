Rock = assemblage of minerals bound together, undifferentiated material, solid organic material.

Rocks can contain fossils in it.

Erratic rock = rock not like surrounding rocks

Basalt = igneous, extrusive, formed at the surface by lava.
Granite = igneous, intrusive, formed underground by magma.

Igneous: Typically have a compact, crystalline texture which is isotropic (uniform, non-laminated). Extrusive rocks (lavas) have small crystals Â«1 mm) due to rapid cooling, intrusive rocks have coarser crystals (1->5 mm) as they cooled more slowly within the Earth. Look for contacts between intrusive bodies and the older rocks into which they were emplaced.

All igneous rocks consist of Granite, Diorite, Gabbro, Peridotite, Rhyolite, Andesite, Basalt, Komatiite.

Sedimentary: Characterized by layering or bedding, a reflection of the discontinuous accumulation of sediment. This may vary from the sub-mm scale to the m scale. Look for evidence of mineral grains (especially quartz) or rock fragments held together by a precipitated cement, and for fossils.

Metamorphic: Often anisotropic (foliated) with plate-like crystals of micas aligned parallel with planes along which preferential splitting occurs. Look for 'uncommon' minerals which may have crystallized in response to changed environmental conditions.

# Rock cycle

Parts:
Sediment, Sedimentary rocks, Metamorphic rocks, Igneous rocks, Magma.

Processes:
Metamorphism process involving heat and pressure. Lithification. Crystallization. Weathering. Melting.

## Metamorphism:

How it happens: When sedimentary rock is buried deep in the crust, heat and pressure change it to metamorphic rock.

Where it leads: When metamorphic rock melts, it becomes magma.

## Crystallization

How it happens: When magma or lava cools and solidifies, igneous rock forms.

What it leads: When weathering occurs, igneous rocks becomes sediment.

## Weathering

How it happens: Weathering breaks down rock that is transported and deposited as sediment.

What it leads: Through lithification, sediment is compacted and cemented to form sedimentary rock.
