Igneous: Typically have a compact, crystalline texture which is isotropic (uniform, non-laminated). Extrusive rocks (lavas) have small crystals Â«1 mm) due to rapid cooling, intrusive rocks have coarser crystals (1->5 mm) as they cooled more slowly within the Earth. Look for contacts between intrusive bodies and the older rocks into which they were emplaced.

Sedimentary: Characterized by layering or bedding, a reflection of the discontinuous accumulation of sediment. This may vary from the sub-mm scale to the m scale. Look for evidence of mineral grains (especially quartz) or rock fragments held together by a precipitated cement, and for fossils.

Metamorphic: Often anisotropic (foliated) with plate-like crystals of micas aligned parallel with planes along which preferential splitting occurs. Look for 'uncommon' minerals which may have crystallized in response to changed environmental conditions.

DRAW THE DAMN ROCK CYCLE

# Weathering

Weathering does not transport materials, it generates the raw materials for transport by agents of wind, ice, gravity.

Process converts rocks to sediment.

Dissolution (minerals breaks down in water), Hydrolysis, Oxidation.
