## James Hutton:

Theory of the Earth, Geologic change is slow, large changes require large amounts of time.

Cycle of Sedimentation, Burial, Mountain Building, Erosion.

## Principle of Uniformitarianism:

Processes that shaped Earth throughout geologic time are the same as those observable today.

The present is the key to the past.

## Sir William Logan

GSC, Mapping, Natural Resources

Helped Canada, mapped things, brought us attention.

## Tuzo Wilson

Major supporter of Theory of Plate Tectonics. Discovered transform faults, that connect the ocean ridge system and divide Earth's lithosphere into rigid plates.

## Earth System is composed into 4 parts:

1. Geosphere: Rocky surface and interior of the Earth
2. Atmosphere: Gaseous envelope
3. Hydrosphere: Water, liquid and frozen
4. Biosphere: Earth's living matter

Two sources of energy are the core and the sun.

Additional spheres:

1. Lithosphere: Outermost layer, behaves rigidly as a nonflowing material. Composed of the crust and upper mantle. This is the material that makes up the tectonic plates.

2. Asthenosphere: upper mantle, below the lithosphere. Shallow under oceanic lithosphere, deeper under continental, flows as a soft solid.
