# Guest lectures - Canada's Oil and Oil Sands

## WC Basins

Basins in the west produce the great majority of Canada's oil and gas and 100% of its viscous oil.

The Precambrian Shield was stable for a great length of time in the west. Tectonically inactive, first sediments laid down at 500 million years ago.

Carbonate reefs ~400 million years ago. Continental chunks slam into the west and start building the Cordillera.

An inland sea was formed, sands and shales.

The Rockies have been inactive for the last 50 million years.

## Oil and gas

1. First you need an organic rock, a shale with 5% algal mass like **kerogen**.

2. Then it has to be buried over 3km deep.

3. Oil must then flow to suitable porous traps:

* Stratigraphic traps
* Fault-controlled traps
* Folds, salt domes or salt sheets
* Or still in the rock like **Shale Oil**

The trapping mechanisms for oil and gas:

* Impermeable barriers
* Capillary barriers, fine-grained strata
* In low permeability source *Shale gas and oil*

## Central Sumatra Basin

Major heavy oil deposits, the largest heavy oil project in south asia.

Canada produces about 40 million barrels of oil per day and is a net exporter of oil.

The average person consumes 25 barrels per something, maybe day.

## McMurray formation

A broad river pain, sediments are being deposited faster than erosion.

## Geological Issues in Oil Sands

Disposition of the strata. River channels, beaches, offshore bars, blanket sands.

Porosity and permeability of the rocks. Lithology is the sands, shale, silt, ironstones. Oil, water and gas saturations.

## Mining Environmental Issues

* Water requirements for processing
* Atmospheric emissions
* Tailings dikes and stability
* Non-consolidating sludge disposal
* Long-term fate of ponds
* Landscape revamping and land reclamation
* Water seepage into the Athabasca River

50% of economic growth in Canada in the last 5 years was related to oil sands.

**Tailings Dykes** = Hot water extraction leads to aqueous tailings, water + minerals + oil

**Shale** = a fine-grained sedimentary rock that forms from the compaction of silt and clay/mud.

Where sediment contains more than 5% organic matter, it eventually forms a rock called **Black Shale**.

Different shale gas deposits in different basins have different properties. No smectite is best, if 5% smectite, water damage can occur from hydraulic fracturing.

Shales with a high Total Organic Carbon content (TOC) and high gamma radiation values are best.

High natural radioactivity.

## Quartz-Illite Shales

* Diagenesis has led to extensive natural fractures
* Absence of smectite is good news
* High brittleness, but low Porosity

We would like to have a minimum of 20 meters of shale with an average porosity of 5-10%.

## Importance of Natural fractures

Naturally existing fractures are largely closed. When we do fracturing, we want to open and connect natural fractures to new fractures.

The properties of the natural fractures are very important but we don't know how to incorporate them into models.

* Fracture cohesion, frictional behaviour, ductility
* Fabric (frequency, orientation, joint sets, etc.)
* Compressibility of fractures and the effect on permeability
* Effect of changing stresses on fracture aperture

## Shale Gas Effects

Shale gas will replace oil in many applications. Gas will partly replace coal for the generation of electrical power.

The economic power of Russia, Venezuela, and Iran is diminishing. The world energy game is changing.

## Hydraulic Fracture

1. Drill a well either vertical or horizontal
2. Access the formation through perforations or similar other methods
3. Then, inject high pressure fluid to fracture the rocks

## Risks:

1. Social impact risks: Shale gas development in Quebec, NB
2. Economic risks: Cheaper hydro power, loss for Manitoba
3. Transportation risks: Oil and Gas pipelines and LNG plants on the West Coast
4. Environmental risks: Impact of a million US wells in the next 50 years
5. Political risks: Provincial resources development QC, NB.
6. Job Opportunity risks: Jobs, infrastructure, better health services
