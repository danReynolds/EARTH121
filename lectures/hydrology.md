# Hydrologic Cycle

How much of Earth's water is **freshwater?**

Where is the most **freshwater** located?

Where is the most **fresh**, **surface water** located?

How much time does a drop of water spend in one compartment?

Varies based on the body.

What are the pathways or processes that connect these compartments?

## Hydrologic Cycle

* Simplified model
* Distribution and Movement
* Reservoirs (compartments)
* pathways (processes)


What drives this cycle?


Stream runoff is an important geologic agent. Flowing water:

Erodes, transports and deposits sediments
Sculpts Landscapes,
Transfers mass from continents to ocean basins.

## How do we characterize the sediment?

Erode (mobilize)
Water, Material

Haul
Solution(dissolved load)
Suspension(suspended load)
Saltation(bed load)
Traction(bed load)

Accumulate
Alluvium
Alluvial Fans and Deltas

Underlined chapters have between 10-20 questions.
Others less than 10

97% of all water is oceanic
2.78% is fresh water
78% of freshwater is at surface
99% of surface freshwater is in ice and glaciers
0.33% freshwater lakes

## Residence Time

How long a droplet spends in one compartment.

Oceans = 1000s of years
Ice caps and Glaciers = 100000 to 1000000 years
Lakes = 10s
Rivers and Streams = Weeks
Atmosphere = Days
