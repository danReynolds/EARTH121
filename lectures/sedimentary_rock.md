# Sedimentary Rock

Recognition of sedimentary rock:

Organization is subparallel strata or beds. Composition is discrete particulate matter. Presence of sedimentary structures and fossils.

## Creation

Create sedimentary rock by:

1. Compaction, the weight of accumulating sediment forces the grains together, thereby reducing the pore space and forcing water out of the sediment.

2. Cementation, pore water expelled from deeply buried sediments migrate upward towards the Earth's surface. Cements them together.

What are the three most common cementing agents for sandstones? Calcite and Silica are very strong cementing agents. Silica is stronger. A third are iron oxides, which stick together.

Lithification is a part of diagenesis. But diagenesis includes all the changes from the break up of the rock to the formation of sedimentary rock.


## What is Sediment?

Sorting of the sediment, are they well sorted or not. Are they angular or rounded. Are they mud, sand, or pebbles.

A sediment is well-sorted if all particles are nearly the same size. These sediments usually have been transported by water or wind.

Two major groups:

1. Chemical Sediment

Inorganic ones like salt deposits, organic ones like decaying swamp vegetation or microscopic marine organisms and coral reefs.

Chemical sediments often consist of minerals precipitated directly from water such as salt deposits produced by the evaporation of small, temporary lakes.

They may also be composed of organic debris such as partially decayed swamp vegetation or the shells of small marine organisms. Main criteria for naming chemical sedimentary rocks is their mineral composition.

Chemical sedimentary rocks include Chalk, Coal, Rock salt, Coquina.

2. Detrital Sediment

Detrital sediments consist of preexisting rock fragments such as glacial debris, river channel sand, sand dunes. Main criterion for naming detrital sedimentary rock is particle size.

Detrital rocks include Breccia, Shale, Sandstone, Congolomerate.

## Sediment to Rock Mappings:

With time and compression:

* **Gravel** with pea-sized or larger particles cements and forms **conglomerate**.

* **Sand** with slightly smaller particles compacts and cements to form **sandstone**.

* **Silty mud** with even finer grain particles becomes **siltstone**.

* **Clayey Mud** the finest grain of all, becomes **shale** or **mudstone**.
