# Sedimentary Rock

Recognition of sedimentary rock:

Organization is subparallel strata or beds. Composition is discrete particulate matter. Presence of sedimentary structures and fossils.

## Creation

Create sedimentary rock by:

1. Compaction, the weight of accumulating sediment forces the grains together, thereby reducing the pore space and forcing water out of the sediment.

2. Cementation, pore water expelled from deeply buried sediments migrate upward towards the Earth's surface. Cements them together.

What are the three most common cementing agents for sandstones? Calcite and Silica are very strong cementing agents. Silica is stronger. A third are iron oxides, which stick together.

Lithification is a part of diagenesis. But diagenesis includes all the changes from the break up of the rock to the formation of sedimentary rock.
