# Mass Wasting

## What do you call the downslope motion of earth materials by gravity?

A type of natural hazard:

* **Natural** feature of the environment.
* Important to the rock cycle
* The initial step in sediment transportation
* A significant agent of landscape change
* Many slopes are unstable, they **change** continuously
* Can cause **damage** to living things and buildings.
* These hazards can produce catastrophic loss
* Mass movement is often aided by **human** activity.

## How do we classify?

### Nature of motion

Type of motion: fall, slide, flow

Rate of movement velocity

type of material: rock/sed/soil

## What are the three major criteria for classifying a mass wasting event?

Motion, Material, Movement

Velocity, how fast is the movement
Material, what it is composed of
Nature of motion, fall, slide or flow

## What is the most obvious factor that affects mass movement?

Describe the slope at right angles to the contours when contours are:

* Closely or widely spaced
* Evenly or unevenly spaced

## How steep is too steep in unconsolidated material?

Loose granular material assumes a slope angle.

**Angle of repose** is a material property due to:

* particle size and shape and the surface roughness

Typical angles of repose:

* Fine sand: 35%
* Coarse sand: 40%
* Angular pebbles: 45%
