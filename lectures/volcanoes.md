# Bowen's Reaction Series

Bowen devised experiments cooling melts. Early crystals settled out. Remaining melt progressively.

He discovered that minerals solidify in a specific series.

Continuous: Plagioclase changed from Ca-rich to Na-rich.

Discontinuous: Minerals start and stop crystallizing. Olivine, Pyroxene, Amphibole, Biotite.

Earth's most abundant minerals:

Crust: Quartz
Asthenosphere: Feldspar
Mantle: Olivine

## Volcano Types:

Active: Presently or expected to erupt.
Dormant: Hasn't erupted in 100s to 1000s of years.
Extinct: Never expected to have another eruption.

## VEI = Volcanic Explosivity Index

There are many impressive examples of volcanic eruptions recorded in the geologic past, historical records and recent observations.

## Flow it or Blow it?

Two dominant styles of eruption:

**Effusive Eruptions**: produce lava flows, commonly basaltic, creating shield volcanoes.

The flow style depends on the temperature, silica content and ease of escape. Low silica means less viscous.

**Explosive Eruptions**: produce pyroclastics, dust, lava, flung into the air. High viscosity. Andesitic and Rhyolitic compositions, create stratovolcanoes. Stratovolcanoes are also called composite volcanoes.

Viscosity of Magma:

Basalt:

Highest eruption temperature
48%-52% silica
Lowest viscosity

Andesite:

High eruption temperature
52%-63% silica
Low viscosity

Dacite:

Low eruption temperature
63%-68% silica
High viscosity

Rhyolite:

Lowest eruption temperature
68%-77% silica
Highest viscosity

Convergent boundaries lead to composite volcanoes.
Divergent boundaries lead to shield volcanoes.
Transform boundaries leads to no volcanoes.

Midterm heavy in Chapter 1.

Warning signs precede most eruptions:

1. Earthquake activity: magma flow increases seismically.
2. Heat Flow: magma causes volcanoes to heat up.
3. Changes in shape: Magma causes volcanoes to inflate.
4. Emaission increases: Changes in gas mix and volume.

## Advantages of volcanoes

Fertile soil, geothermal energy, tourism, landscape and scenery.

## Pyroclastic Flows and Surges

Responsible for some of the worst natural hazards in the last century.

Most hazardous, avalanche of hot ash, gas, rocks.

Can flow up to 100km.

Flows are dense, larger material, more momentum at 100-150km/h.

Surges, faster, more mobile, less dense at 350km/h
