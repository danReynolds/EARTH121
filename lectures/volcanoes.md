# Bowen's Reaction Series

Bowen devised experiments cooling melts. Early crystals settled out. Remaining melt progressively.

He discovered that minerals solidify in a specific series.

Continuous: Plagioclase changed from Ca-rich to Na-rich.

Discontinuous: Minerals start and stop crystallizing. Olivine, Pyroxene, Amphibole, Biotite.

Earth's most abundant minerals:

Crust: Quartz
Asthenosphere: Feldspar
Mantle: Olivine

## Volcano Types:

Active: Presently or expected to erupt.
Dormant: Hasn't erupted in 100s to 1000s of years.
Extinct: Never expected to have another eruption.

## VEI = Volcanic Explosivity Index

There are many impressive examples of volcanic eruptions recorded in the geologic past, historical records and recent observations.

## Flow it or Blow it?

Two dominant styles of eruption:

**Effusive Eruptions**: produce lava flows, commonly basaltic, creating shield volcanoes.

The flow style depends on the temperature, silica content and ease of escape. Low silica means less viscous.

**Explosive Eruptions**: produce pyroclastics, dust, lava, flung into the air. High viscosity. Andesitic and Rhyolitic compositions, create stratovolcanoes.

Viscosity of Magma:

Basalt:

Highest eruption temperature
48%-52% silica
Lowest viscosity

Andesite:

High eruption temperature
52%-63% silica
Low viscosity

Dacite:

Low eruption temperature
63%-68% silica
High viscosity

Rhyolite:

Lowest eruption temperature
68%-77% silica
Highest viscosity
