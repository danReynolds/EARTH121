# Different Types of Weathering

Physical processes, physical breakdown and disintegration. No compositional change.

Chemical processes, chemical alteration (decomposition) and chemical change.

Factors that affect Weathering:

* Exposure, sun, wind precipitation. Amount of vegetation and biological activity.

* Tectonic Setting: Young rising mountain ranges like the Himalaya, weather very rapidly.

* Rock Structure: The pace of weathering is also strongly affected by the closeness of joints.

* Topography: Weathering proceeds more quickly on a steep slope than a gentle one.

* Vegetation: Plants contribute to both mechanical and chemical weathering. The removal of plants through slash-and-burn agriculture, clear-cut logging or natural landslides also accelerate weathering.

* Biological Activity: Animals contribute significantly to the breakdown of rocks. Algae feed on bacterium that thrive in acidic runoff.

* Composition: Different minerals weather at different rates. Calcite weathers quickly by dissolution and feldspar weathers at an intermediate rate. Quartz is very resistant to weathering, because it dissolves very slowly and is not affected by ion exchange.
