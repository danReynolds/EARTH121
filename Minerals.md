# Minerals

**Minerals** are any naturally occurring inorganic solids that possess an orderly internal structure and a definite chemical composition.

A mineral must then:

1. Occur naturally
2. Must be solid at surface temperatures and pressures
3. Must possess an orderly internal structure, its atoms must be arranged in a definite pattern
4. It must have a definite chemical composition that can vary within specified limits
5. It is usually inorganic, although some can be mediated by biological processes

Synthetic diamonds, etc are therefore not minerals.

**Rocks** = any solid mass of mineral or mineral-like matter that occurs naturally as part of our planet. Most rocks, like granite, occur as aggregates of different minerals, each of which retains its characteristic physical and chemical properties.

Some rocks like obsidian and pumice are not composed of mineral matter. Coal is composed of organic matter.

## Composition of Minerals

Most minerals are combinations of multiple elements. Cue big discussion on atoms, and such. We know all that.

Bonding, compounds, etc.

Elements that are able to join together in more than one geometric arrangement can have the same composition, but exhibit different characteristics.

Polymorphs are minerals that can have different geometric arrangements. Graphite and diamond are both just carbon, but have very different properties.

Some minerals transform from one polymorph to another as a result of pressure and temperature.


## Physical Properties of Minerals

* Crystal Habit (Shape): the external expression of a mineral that reflects the orderly internal arrangement of atoms.

* Lustre: the appearance or quality of light reflected from the surface of a mineral crystal. Some minerals look like polished metal and have a metallic lustre. Some have a non-metallic lustre and can be glassy in appearance like quartz, or pearly, silky, resinous, or dull.

* Colour: Colour of a mineral specimen is obvious. But can form easily as a result of different impurities that affect color.

* Streak: colour of a mineral in its powdered form, obtained by rubbing it against a piece of unglazed porcelain called a streak plate.

* Hardness: Mohs scale is used to determine hardness by rubbing minerals against each-other, one with a known hardness.

Scale consists of 10 minerals arranged in order from softest to hardest.

* Cleavage: tendency of a mineral to break along planes of weak bonding. Minerals that have cleavage can be identified by the distinctive smooth surfaces produced when the minerals are broken. Some minerals reveal several cleavage plains when broken, or some none.

When minerals break evenly in multiple directions, cleavage is described as the number of planes exhibited and the angles at which they meet.

* Fracture: minerals having chemical bonds of similar strength in all directions, and therefore lacking the ability to cleave along certain planes within crystals may fracture. Quartz fractures into smooth curved surfaces resembling broken glass or the inside of seashells. This is called conchoidal fracturing.

Some minerals fracture into splinters or fibres.

* Specific Gravity: ratio of the weight of a mineral to the weight of an equal volume of water.

If a mineral weights 3 times as much as an equal volume of water, it has specific gravity 3.

## Mineral Classes

4660 minerals named, only a few dozen are common. These few make up most rocks of Earth's crust and are classified as **rock-forming minerals**. The eight elements that make up most of these minerals in order of abundance are:

Oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium.

### Silicates

Every silicate mineral contains the elements of oxygen and silicon.

The most common examples are the feldspars, field crystals, that are the most abundant silicate minerals.

Quartz, the second most abundant mineral in continental crust, is the only mineral made completely of silicon and oxygen.

Silicate materials readily form when magma cools and solidifies. Quartz forms at lower temperatures, while minerals like olivine crystallize at higher temperatures.

Each silicate mineral has a structure and a chemical composition that indicate the conditions under which it was formed. Geologists can examine rocks and determine the circumstances under which it was formed.

### Ferromagnesian (Dark) Silicates

The dark silicates, or ferromagnesian silicates are those minerals containing ions of iron or magnesuium or both in their structure.

Because of iron content, they are darker and have higher specific gravities.

The most common is olivine, which is black to olive-green and has a glassy lustre and conchoidal fracture.

**Pyroxenes** = group of complex minerals that are important components of dark igneous rocks. Augite is a dark mineral with two direction of cleavage that meet at nearly 90 degrees.

There are more but they're just rocks.

### NonFerroMagnesian Light Silicates

Light in colour and with a lower specific gravity, attributed to the absence of iron or magnesium.

Muscovite is one example and a member of the mica group. It lends a sparkle to rocks and has excellent cleavage. If you see glimmering beach sand, you may have seen the mica flakes scattered among other sand grains.

### Gemstones

**Precious gemstone** = has beauty, durability, size and rarity.

**Semi-precious gemstone** = proper subset of those qualities.
