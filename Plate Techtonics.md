# Scientific Revolution

In the 50s and 60s the ocean floor was mapped and the global oceanic ridge system was discovered.

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge parallels the continental margins on both sides of the Atlantic.

Tectonic activity occurs at great depths beneath the ocean.

## Sea-floor Spreading Hypothesis

In the 60s, Harry Hess proposed that the ocean ridges are located above zones of upwelling in the mantle. As rising material from the mantle spreads as a a result of the convection motion of the mantle, sea floor is carried in a conveyor-belt fashion deep into the ocean trenches, where the floor descends into the mantle.

Tensional forces fracture the crust and allow magma to intrude and generate new pieces of oceanic crust.

As the sea floor moves away from the ridge crest, newly formed crust replaces it.

## Geomagnetic Reversals

Earth's magnetic field periodically reverses polarity. A rock solidifying during one of the reversals will be magnitized with oppose polarity.

**Normal Polarity** = rocks exhibit the same magnetism as the present magnetic field.

**Reversed Polarity** = rocks exhibiting the opposite polarity as the current magnetic field.

Researchers discovered alternating stripes of high and low intensity magnetism that trend parallel to ridge crests.

In 63, Morley suggested that high-intensity stripes were regions where the crust exhibits normal polarity. These rocks therefore enhance the existing magnetic field.

As magma solidifies along the narrow rifts at the crest of an oceanic ridge, it is magnetized with the polarity of the existing magnetic field. Because of sea-floor spreading, this stripe of magnetized crust increases in width.

When Earth switches polarity, any newly formed sea floor would form in the middle of the old stripe. The two parts of the old stripe are carried in opposite directions away from the ridge crest.

Subsequent reversals would build a mirror-image pattern of normal and reverse stripes as the sea-floor spreads and the polarities periodically change.

## Plate tectonics

**Plate tectonics** = the composite of a variety of ideas that explain observed motion of Earth's lithosphere through the mechanisms of subduction and sea-floor spreading, which in turn generate continents and ocean basins.

Tuzo Wilson suggested that large faults connected the global mobile belts into a network that divides Earth's outer shell into several rigid plates.

Wilson described three types of plate margins and how solid blocks of Earth's outer shell moved relative to one-another. His theories became the modern opinion plate tectonics.

By the end of the 60s, continental drift, sea-floor spreading were united and life made sense.

**Divergent plate boundaries** are located along the crests of oceanic ridges and are constructive because they introduce new oceanic lithosphere that rises and fills the gap.

## Pangaea Breakup

Began breaking 180 million years ago. Atlantic ocean basin was created.

First rift developed between North America and Africa.
