# Igneous Rock

With the exception of the Earth's core, the remaining solid portion of the planet is basically a big mass of igneous rocks that is partially covered by a thin veneer of sedimentary and metamorphic rock.

## Magma: The Parent Material of Igneous Rock

Magma is formed by partial melting, which occurs at various levels within the Earth's crust and upper mantle to the depths of 250km.

A magma body buoyantly rises towards the surface because it is less dense than surrounding rocks.

Molten rock can break through, resulting in a volcanic eruption. Magma that reaches the surface is called lava.

Igneous rocks that form when magma solidifies at the surface are called **extrusive** or **volcanic**.

Magma that loses its mobility and crystallizes at depth are termed **intrusive** or **plutonic**.

Earth's crust and mantle are composed primarily of solid, not molten rock. The outer core is fluid, but remains deep within the planet.

Magma originates when solid rock located in the upper mantle and crust melts.

In the upper crust, it averages about 25 degrees celsius hotter per kilometre descended.

This change in temperature with depth is called the **geothermal gradient**. At 100km down, it is between 1200 and 1400 celsius. At these temps, rocks in the lower crust and upper mantle are near their melting point.

The majority of magma forms without aid from an additional heat source. Rock that is near its melting point cna met if the pressure drops or if volatiles, fluids and gases are introduced.

## Role of pressure

Pressure prevents rocks from melting in the mantle. When confining pressure drops, **decompression melting** occurs. This can be caused when rock ascends as a result of convective upwelling and is noticed along ocean ridges where plates are rifting apart.

## Role of volatiles

Water and other volatiles cause rock to melt at lower temperatures. The effect of volatiles is magnified by increased pressure.

Wet rock buried at depth has a much lower melting temp than dry rock under the same conditions.

When oceanic lithosphere descend into the mantle, heat and pressure drive water from the rock, into the wedge of hot mantle, lowering the melting point of mantle rock and causing magma to form.

Conditions under which magma can be generated:

1. Heat can be added
2. Pressure can be decreased
3. Volatiles can be added

## Nature of Magma

Most magma has three parts:

1. Liquid portion: called melt, composed of mobile ions of elemnts commonly found in Earth's crust.
2. Solid portion: silicate minerals that have crystallized from the melt. As magma cools, solid portion increases.
3. Gaseous portion: water vapour, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide are the most common volatile components of magma.

## Crystallization

As magma cools, the ions in the melt lose mobility and crystallize. Eventually, all of the melt is transformed into a solid mass of interlocking silicate minerals that are called igneous rock.

Magma can crystallize at a range of 200 degrees celsius, not a precise temperature like with water.

A single magma can generate rocks with widely differing compositions and a variety of igneous rocks exist.

**Magmatic differentiation** = formation of one or more secondary magmas from a single parent magma.

**Assimilation** = as magma rises upward, it incorporates some of the surrouding host rock. Stress causes numerous cracks in the overlying rock.

**Magma Mixing** = one magma body intrudes another and once combined, convective flow can stir the two magmas and generate a fluid with an intermediate composition.

Bowen demonstrates that a single parent magma can generate many different igneous rocks. This process accounts in part for the great diversity of magmas and igneous rocks.

## Partial Melting and Magma formation

Melting spans a large temperature range. As rocks melt, the minerals with the lowest melting temp go first.

Mafic magma comes from partial melting of peridotite, a dark-coloured igneous rock. Mafic magmas that originate from direct melting of mantle rock are called primary magmas.

As mafic magma migrates upward, the confining pressure diminishes and reduces its melting temp.

## Formation of Andesitic and Felsic magmas

Only found within or adjacent to continental margins. Interactions between mantle-derived mafic magmas and more silica-rich components of Earth's crust generate these magmas.
The result is the formation of a more silica rich magma of intermediate composition or andesitic composition (between mafic and felsic).

Felsic melts are higher in silica and more viscous than other magmas. They are also formed at lower temperatures than other magmas. They usually lose their mobility before reaching the surface.

## Igneous compositions

Igneous rocks are mainly composed of oxygen and silicon.

**Felsic rocks** = rocks composed almost entirely of light-coloured silicates like quartz and feldspar. Granite is the most common felsic rock. Viscous and still liquid at 650C.

**Mafic rocks** = rocks that contain substantial dark silicate minerals and calcium-rich feldspar but no quartz. Basalt is the most common mafic rock. More fluid, completely solid at 1000C.

**Ultramafic rocks** = composed of peridotite, with olivine and pyroxene, all ferromagnesian minerals. Rare at the surface, but peridotite is prevalent in the upper mantle.

Silica content ranges from 40% in ultramafic rocks to 70% in felsic rocks.

## Igneous Textures

Texture describes the overall appearance of a rock based on the size, shape and arrangement of its interlocking crystals.

Texture reveals a lot about the environment in which the rock is formed.

Three factors influence the texture of igneous rocks:

1. The rate at which magma cools
2. The amount of silica present
3. The amount of volatiles in the magma

Slow cooling promotes the growth of fewer but larger crystals.

Rapid cooling has small crystals, or even no crystal network, which creates glass igneous rock.

**Megascopic features** = features that can be determined with the unaided eye or with low magnification.

## Aphanitic Fine-Grained Texture

Igneous rocks at the surface where cooling is rapid possess a fine-grained texture termed **aphanitic**. Light-coloured aphinitic rocks are those containing primarily light-coloured nonferromagnesian silicate materials.

**Vesicular texture** = the void in rock left by gas bubbles that escape as the lava solidifes.

## Phaneritic Course-Grained Texture

Large masses of magma that slowly solidify far below the surface. These course-grained rocks consist of a mass of inter-grown crystals.

## Porphyritic Texture

Magma containing large crystals that erupts at the surface has a polyphyritic texture. The large crystals in the rock are referred to as **phenocrysts** and the matrix of its smaller crystals are called **ground mass**.

## Glassy Texture

Molten rock is extruded into water or into the atmosphere in some eruptions, where it is cooled very quickly. Rapid cooling results in a glassy texture, when ions are cooled before they can form crystals.

Magma with high silica content tends to form long, chainlike structures before crystallization.

## Pyroclastic Texture

Some igneous rocks are formed from the consolidation of fragments ejected during volcanic eruptions. These amalgamated fragment rocks have a pyroclastic texture.

*Welded tuff* is composed of fine fragments of glass that remain hot enough during flight to fuse together on impact.

Look more like sedimentary rock often than standard igneous.

## Pegmatitic Texture

Very coarse-grained, composed of interlocking crystals, most larger than a cm in diameter. Found in small masses around the margins of large plutons or in thin dykes and veins.

Form in the late stages of crystallization when water and other volatiles like chlorine make up a high percentage of the melt. Contain large crystals of quartz, feldspar and muscovite.

## Felsic Igneous Rocks

Granite is the best known of all igneous rocks, and is felsic. Granite is phaneritic in texture, 20% quartz and 65% feldspar.

**Rhyolite** = extrusive equivalent of granite and like granite, is composed of light-coloured silicates. Buff to pink or light grey in color. Aphanitic, with glass fragments and voids indicating rapid cooling in a surface environment.

**Obsidian** = dark-coloured glassy rock that forms when silica-rich lava is quenched quickly. Ions in glass are unordered, glassy rocks such as obsidian are not composed minerals in the strict sense.

High silica count, by itself silica is clear, dark colour comes from metallic ions. Conchoidal fractures, hold sharp, hard edge.

**Pumice** = volcanic rock with frothy texture. Forms when large amounts of gas escape through lava to generate a grey, frothy mass. Lots of voids in the rock, holding air and making it float in water.

## Intermediate Andesitic Igneous Rocks

**Andesite** = medium-grey fine-grained volcanic rock. Has a porphyritic texture. Contains minor amounts of quartz, resembles rhyolite.

**Diorite** = plutonic equivalent of andesite. Coarse-grained intrusive rock that looks like grey granite. It can be distinguished from granite by the absence of visible quartz crystals, higher percentage of dark silicate materials. Has a salt-and-pepper appearance.

**Basalt** = very dark green to black fine-grained volcanic rock composed mostly of pyroxene and calcium-rich feldspar.

Basalt is the most common extrusive igneous rock. Many volcanic islands are composed of mainly basalt.

**Gabbro** = intrusive equivalent of basalt. Very dark green to black in colour and composed of mostly the same thing. Large portions of the magma found in the subsurface magma chambers that once fed basalt flows eventually solidify at depth to form gabbro.

**Peridotite** = Upper mantle is dominated by this phaneritic rock. Has an ultramafic composition, primarily composed of olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar. Appears on the surface in small amounts as a result of mantle rock pushed up to the surface in some form of mountain building, and to small amounts sent to the surface by basaltic, mafic magma.

**Tuff** = most common pyroclastic rock, composed mainly of tiny ash-size fragments, that are later cemented together. When ash particles fuse, the rock is called welded tuff. Consists mostly of tiny glass shards. May also contain walnut sized pieces of pumice and other rocks.

Welded tuffs cover much once volcanic land in the West.

## Nature of Plutons

Plutons form beneath the Earth's surface and vary in size and shape. They are either tabular or massive based on their shape and orientation. Intrusive rocks are **discordant** if they cut across existing rocks and **concordant** if they from parallel to sedimentary layers.

# Dykes

Dykes are tabular discordant plutons produced when magma is injected into fractures. The force of the magma can further separate the walls of the fracture. These wall-like structures range from 1cm-1km thick.

# Sills

Tabular concordant plutons formed when magma is injected along sedimentary bedding surfaces and are called sills. Product of fluid mafic magmas in shallow environments. Sills closely resemble buried laval flows. Both are tabular and have columnar jointing. **Columnar joints** form as igneous rocks cool and develop shrinkage fractures that produce long, pillar-like columns.

To distiniguish between a sill and a buried lava flow, the upper portion of a buried lava flow usually has voids produced by escaping gas bubbles, while sills form when magma has been forcefully intruded between sedimentary rocks and has baked zones in the rock above and below. Buried lava flows have baked zones only below, not on the overlying rock as well.

## Laccoliths

Similar to sills because they form when magma intrudes between sedimentary layers. The magma that generates laccoliths is more viscous and collects as a blister-like mass that arches the overlying strata upward. Creates a dome-shaped bulge at the surface at most a few kilometres large.


## Batholiths

The largest intrusive igneous bodies. Most commonly occurring in groups that form extensive belts hundreds of kilometres long and wide.

A plutonic body must have a surface exposed greater than 100 square kilometres to be considered a batholith.

Smaller plutons are called stocks.

Batholiths may compose the core of mountain systems.

Magma can move through solid rock, such as in the case of **xenoliths** which are unmelted pieces of the host rock found in the pluton after it has been exposed by erosion.
