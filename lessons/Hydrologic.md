# Earth as a System: The Hydrologic Cycle

96.5% of the planet's water is stored in the global oceans. Ice sheets and glaciers account for 1.74% and 2% is divided among lakes, streams, subsurface water and the atmosphere.

Water is constantly moving among the hydrosphere, atmosphere and geosphere and biosphere and this unending circulation of Earth's water supply is called the **hydrologic cycle**.

Powered by the sun, water evaporates into the atmosphere and winds transport the moisture-laden air for great distances until conditions cause the moisture to condense into clouds and precipitate.

Water soaks into the ground called **infiltration**, moving downward, laterally and finally seeping into lakes and streams or directly into the ocean.

When the rate of rainfall is greater than the land's ability to absorb it, the additional water flows over the surface into lakes and streams, called **runoff**.

Also, some of the water that infiltrates the ground is absorbed by plants, which later release it into the atmosphere. This process is called **transpiration**, meaning to breath across.

Running water is the single most important natural erosional agent shaping Earth's landscape.

## From Sheet Flow to Channel Flow

The amount of water that runs off rather than sinking into the ground depends on the **infiltration capacity**, which is controlled by:

1. The intensity and duration of the rainfall
2. The prior wetted condition of the soil
3. The soil texture
4. The slope of the land
5. The nature of the vegetative cover

When the soil becomes saturated, **sheet flow** commences as a thin, unconfined sheet of water flowing over the ground for a short distance before threads of current develop, forming channels called **rills**.

Rills direct water to more stable channels of streams. A stream flows in a channel, whereas a river is a stream that carries large amounts of water and has many tributaries.

## Basic Components of a Stream

Streams have a **head**, **mouth** - where it empties into another water body,
and flow in a channel.

A Stream follows a **course** and any given segment of a stream along its course is a **reach**.

**Meanders** are snake-like bends in rivers.

The **bed** of the stream is bounded on either side by **banks**.

The area adjacent to the stream is usually flat and are filled with water during floods and are called **flood plains**.

## Streamflow

Water can flow either as **laminar flow** or **turbulent flow**.

**Laminar Flow**: water flows in a straight path that are parallel to the channel.

**Turbulent Flow**: Water commonly moves in a chaotic and erratic fashion as swirling, whirlpool-like eddies.

Laminar flow is only possible when water is moving very slowly through a smooth channel. If the velocity increases or the channel becomes rough, laminar flow changes to turbulent flow.

The ability of a stream to erode and transport material is related to its velocity, which depends on:

* The gradient
* The shape
* The size
* The roughness of the channel
* The discharge

## Gradient and Channel Characteristics

Gradient is the vertical drop of a stream over a fixed distance. The steeper the gradient, the faster the stream moves.

The **cross-sectional** shape of a channel determines the amount of water in contact with the channel and the frictional drag.

The most efficient channels have the least perimeter for its cross-sectional area.

All other things equal, a stream with a smaller surface perimeter, the area where the water touches the ground, will have less friction and will flow faster. Consider the ratio of the area to the perimeter. Higher area, smaller perimeter = faster.

The size and roughness of the channel also contribute to friction, a smooth channel promotes a more uniform flow, water in an irregular channel can even form **rapids**, channels where turbulent flow extends up to the surface.

## Discharge and Changes Downstream

The **discharge** of a stream is the amount of water flowing past a certain point in a given amount of time.

Discharge is described by $\frac{m^{3}}{s}$

The stream will increase the size of its channel by widening and deepening it so that less water is in contact with the bed and banks of the channel.

Friction is reduced and the water flows faster.

In the headwaters region where the gradient is steepest, the water must flow in a relatively small and often boulder-strewn channel.

This creates drag and turbulent flow.

Downstream, the bed material becomes smaller, offering less resistance to flow,
and the width and depth of the channel increases to accommodate greater discharge.

These factors permit water to flow more freely and rapidly and compensate
for the decrease in gradient. A stream can therefore maintain a higher velocity
near its mouth than upstream because of the greater discharge, larger channel and smoother bed.

## Stream Erosion

Streams erode their channels mainly by the plucking of loosened particles from their beds and by abrasion.

Some erosion is also by the dissolution of soluble bedrock and channel debris.

Common features of some riverbeds are rounded depressions called **potholes**. They are created by the abrasive action of particles swirling in fast-moving eddies.

The rotational motion of the sand and pebbles acts like a drill to bore the holes.

## Dissolved Load

Most dissolved load is supplied by groundwater. As water percolates through the ground, it acquires soluble soil components, then ions, from deeper cracks and pores in bedrock.

Eventually, much of this ion-rich water finds its way into streams.

The velocity of stream flow has essentially no effect on a stream's ability to carry its dissolved loads.

## Suspended Load

Most streams carry the largest part of their load in **suspension**. The visible cloud of sediment suspended in the water is the most obvious portion of a stream's load.

During flood stage, larger particles are suspended as well. Then the total quantity of material carried in suspension increases dramatically.

The type and amount of material carried in suspension are controlled by two factors: the velocity of the water and the settling velocity of each sediment grain.

**Settling Velocity** = the speed which a particle falls through a stationary fluid. The larger the particle, the more rapidly it settles toward the streambed.

## Bed Load

Coarser particles move along the bed of the channel as **bed load**. The particles that make up the bed load move by rolling, sliding and saltation.

Sediment moving by **saltation**, leaping, appear to be jumping or skippnig along the streambed as particles are propelled upward by collisions or lifted by currents.

## Capacity and Competence

A stream's ability to carry solid particles is described by two criteria.

The **maximum load** of solid particles that a stream can transport per unit of time is termed its **capacity**. The greater the discharge, the greater is the stream's capacity for hauling sediment.

**Competence** of a stream is the maximum particle size that a stream can transport, based on its velocity. Fast streams have a greater competence than slower streams.

The increase in discharge results in greater capacity, the increased velocity produces greater competence.

With rising velocity the water becomes more turbulant.

## Deposition of Sediment By Streams

Whenever a stream's velocity slows, its competence is reduced and particles of sediment are deposited when their critical settling velocity is reached. This process called sorting, explains why particles of similar size are deposited together.

Sediment deposited by streams is called **alluvium** and includes channel deposits, floodplain deposits, or deposits near the mouth.

## Channel deposits

Alluvium deposited within a stream's channel is mostly sand and gravel **bars**.

**Natural levees** are masses of sand and gravel deposited on floodplains that form a slope away from the stream channel, since when it floods more alluvium is deposited close to the stream on the floodplain than far away, creating this slope.

## Graded Stream

A stream that has attained a balance of energy required to transport its load and experiences no net erosion or deposition.

Time lets the stream approach equilibrium with its new conditions.

The **base level** is the lowest elevation to which a stream can erode its bed. Base level most commonly corresponds to the elevation at which a stream enters another water body, where, on escaping the confinement of its channel, it loses velocity and loses its ability to erode.

Sea level is the ultimate base level.

**Braided Stream** = stream deposits materials on the floor of its channel, and these can prevent further water from passing, causing the stream to fork and rejoin in a network of channels that we called braided together.

**Meandering Stream** = Streams that occupy broad floodplains, whether erosional or depositional, have a single channel with sweeping meanders.

## Alluvial Fans and Deltas

Two of the most common landforms composed of alluvium are alluvial fans and deltas. They are deposited as a result of a loss of competence of a stream.

Alluvial fans are deposited on land, whereas deltas are deposited in a body of water.

Alluvial fans can be steep, whereas deltas are usually pretty flat.

### Alluvial Fans

Typically develop where a high-gradient stream leaves a narrow valley in mountainous terrain and comes out suddenly onto a broad, flat plain or valley floor.

Alluvial fans form in response to the abrupt drop in gradient combined with the change from a narrow channel of a mountain stream to the less confined channels at the base of a mountain.

The sudden drop in velocity causes the stream to dump its load of sediment quickly in a cone or fan-shaped accumulation.

### Deltas

A delta forms when a stream enters an ocean or a lake. As the stream's flow is checked on entering the lake, the dying current deposits its load of sediments in three types of beds:

1. **Foreset beds** composed of coarser particles that drop almost immediately on entering the lake to form layers that slope downcurrent on the *delta front*.

2. **Topset beds** that cover foreset beds, dominated by mud and plant debris on the upper surface of the delta.

3. **Bottomset beds** that consistent of the finer silts and clays that settle some distance from the mouth on an area called the *prodelta*.

As the delta grows outward, the channel becomes choked with sediment from the slowing water. The water then divides from the main channel into smaller ones, called **distributaries**.

Rather than **tributaries**, which carry water into the main channel, **distributaries** carry water away from the main channel in varying paths.

## Drainage Patterns

The **drainage basin** is the land area that contributes water to the stream. The drainage basin of one stream is separated from another by an elongated topographic high called a **divide**.

Divides range in size from a ridge separating two gullies to continental basins.

The Mississipi river has the largest drainage basin in North America.

**Dendritic Pattern** = most common drainage pattern. Characterized by irregular branching of tributaries that resembles the branches of a tree.

**Radial Pattern** = streams that diverge from a central area, like spokes from the hub of a wheel.

**Rectangular Pattern** = many right-angle bends, where the bedrock is criss-crossed by joints and faults.

## Headward Erosion and Stream Piracy

A stream can lengthen its course by **headwater erosion**, extending from the head of its valley upslope. **Stream piracy** is the diversion of the drainage of one stream because of the headward erosion of another stream.

If a stream on one side of a divide has a steeper gradient and more energy than a stream on the other side, it can extend its valley headward, eventually breaking down the divide and capturing part or all of the drainage of the slower stream.

## Floods and Flood Control

The **recurrence interval** is an estimate of how often a flood of a given size can be expected to occur.

## Causes and Types of Floods

### Regional Floods

Rapid melting of snow in spring and heavy rain can overwhelm a river. Regional floods are commonly caused by slow-moving storm systems, like decaying hurricanes.

## Flash Floods

Factors influencing flash flooding include rainfall intensity and duration, surface conditions and topography.

Mountainous areas are susceptible because steep slopes can funnel runoff into narrow canyons.

Urban areas are also at risk because a high percentage of the surface area is composed of impervious roofs, streets and parking lots where runoff is rapid.

Streets, etc cover the ground that once soaked up water. Less water infiltrates and the rate and amount of runoff increase.

## Ice-Jam Floods

As the level of a stream rises, it breaks up the ice and creates ice flows that can pile up to make channel obstructions, or an ice dam. Water upstream from the ice can rise and overflow the channel banks.

When the ice dam fails, the water stored behind the dam is released, causing a flash flood downstream.

## Dam-Failure Flood

Dams and artificial levees are built for flood protection of a certain magnitude, if the dam or levee fails, a flash flood occurs.

## Flood Control

### Artificial Levees

Earthen mounds built on the banks of a river to increase the volume of water the channel can hold.

### Flood-Control Dams

Built to store floodwater and then let it out slowly. Lowers the flood crest by spreading it out over a longer time.

### Channellization

Involves alteration of a stream channel to speed the flow of water and prevent it from reaching flood height. Can mean clearing a channel of obstructions, or dredging a channel to make it wider or deeper.

Can create artificial cutoffs that shorten and straighten the stream, increasing the gradient, velocity, discharge and erosion.
