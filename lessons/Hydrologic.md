# Earth as a System: The Hydrologic Cycle

96.5% of the planet's water is stored in the global oceans. Ice sheets and glaciers account for 1.74% and 2% is divided among lakes, streams, subsurface water and the atmosphere.

Water is constantly moving among the hydrosphere, atmosphere and geosphere and biosphere and this unending circulation of Earth's water supply is called the **hydrologic cycle**.

Powered by the sun, water evaporates into the atmosphere and winds transport the moisture-laden air for great distances until conditions cause the moisture to condense into clouds and precipitate.

Water soaks into the ground called **infiltration**, moving downward, laterally and finally seeping into lakes and streams or directly into the ocean.

When the rate of rainfall is greater than the land's ability to absorb it, the additional water flows over the surface into lakes and streams, called **runoff**.

Also, some of the water that infiltrates the ground is absorbed by plants, which later release it into the atmosphere. This process is called **transpiration**, meaning to breath across.

Running water is the single most important natural erosional agent shaping Earth's landscape.

## From Sheet Flow to Channel Flow

The amount of water that runs off rather than sinking into the ground depends on the **infiltration capacity**, which is controlled by:

1. The intensity and duration of the rainfall
2. The prior wetted condition of the soil
3. The soil texture
4. The slope of the land
5. The nature of the vegetative cover

When the soil becomes saturated, **sheet flow** commences as a thin, unconfined sheet of water flowing over the ground for a short distance before threads of current develop, forming channels called **rills**.

Rills direct water to more stable channels of streams. A stream flows in a channel, whereas a river is a stream that carries large amounts of water and has many tributaries.

## Basic Components of a Stream

Streams have a **head**, **mouth** - where it empties into another water body,
and flow in a channel.

A Stream follows a **course** and any given segment of a stream along its course is a **reach**.

**Meanders** are snake-like bends in rivers.

The **bed** of the stream is bounded on either side by **banks**.

The area adjacent to the stream is usually flat and are filled with water during floods and are called **flood plains**.

## Streamflow

Water can flow either as **laminar flow** or **turbulent flow**.

**Laminar Flow**: water flows in a straight path that are parallel to the channel.

**Turbulent Flow**: Water commonly moves in a chaotic and erratic fashion as swirling, whirlpool-like eddies.

Laminar flow is only possible when water is moving very slowly through a smooth channel. If the velocity increases or the channel becomes rough, laminar flow changes to turbulent flow.

The ability of a stream to erode and transport material is related to its velocity, which depends on:

* The gradient
* The shape
* The size
* The roughness of the channel
* The discharge

## Gradient and Channel Characteristics

Gradient is the vertical drop of a stream over a fixed distance. The steeper the gradient, the faster the stream moves.

The **cross-sectional** shape of a channel determines the amount of water in contact with the channel and the frictional drag.

The most efficient channels have the least perimeter for its cross-sectional area.

All other things equal, a stream with a smaller surface perimeter, the area where the water touches the ground, will have less friction and will flow faster. Consider the ratio of the area to the perimeter. Higher area, smaller perimeter = faster.

The size and roughness of the channel also contribute to friction, a smooth channel promotes a more uniform flow, water in an irregular channel can even form **rapids**, channels where turbulent flow extends up to the surface.
