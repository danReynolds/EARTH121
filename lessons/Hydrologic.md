# Earth as a System: The Hydrologic Cycle

96.5% of the planet's water is stored in the global oceans. Ice sheets and glaciers account for 1.74% and 2% is divided among lakes, streams, subsurface water and the atmosphere.

Water is constantly moving among the hydrosphere, atmosphere and geosphere and biosphere and this unending circulation of Earth's water supply is called the **hydrologic cycle**.

Powered by the sun, water evaporates into the atmosphere and winds transport the moisture-laden air for great distances until conditions cause the moisture to condense into clouds and precipitate.

Water soaks into the ground called **infiltration**, moving downward, laterally and finally seeping into lakes and streams or directly into the ocean.

When the rate of rainfall is greater than the land's ability to absorb it, the additional water flows over the surface into lakes and streams, called **runoff**.

Also, some of the water that infiltrates the ground is absorbed by plants, which later release it into the atmosphere. This process is called **transpiration**, meaning to breath across.

Running water is the single most important natural erosional agent shaping Earth's landscape.

## From Sheet Flow to Channel Flow

The amount of water that runs off rather than sinking into the ground depends on the **infiltration capacity**, which is controlled by:

1. The intensity and duration of the rainfall
2. The prior wetted condition of the soil
3. The soil texture
4. The slope of the land
5. The nature of the vegetative cover

When the soil becomes saturated, **sheet flow** commences as a thin, unconfined sheet of water flowing over the ground for a short distance before threads of current develop, forming channels called **rills**.

Rills direct water to more stable channels of streams. A stream flows in a channel, whereas a river is a stream that carries large amounts of water and has many tributaries.

## Basic Components of a Stream

Streams have a **head**, **mouth** - where it empties into another water body,
and flow in a channel.

A Stream follows a **course** and any given segment of a stream along its course is a **reach**.

**Meanders** are snake-like bends in rivers.

The **bed** of the stream is bounded on either side by **banks**.

The area adjacent to the stream is usually flat and are filled with water during floods and are called **flood plains**.

## Streamflow

Water can flow either as **laminar flow** or **turbulent flow**.

**Laminar Flow**: water flows in a straight path that are parallel to the channel.

**Turbulent Flow**: Water commonly moves in a chaotic and erratic fashion as swirling, whirlpool-like eddies.

Laminar flow is only possible when water is moving very slowly through a smooth channel. If the velocity increases or the channel becomes rough, laminar flow changes to turbulent flow.

The ability of a stream to erode and transport material is related to its velocity, which depends on:

* The gradient
* The shape
* The size
* The roughness of the channel
* The discharge

## Gradient and Channel Characteristics

Gradient is the vertical drop of a stream over a fixed distance. The steeper the gradient, the faster the stream moves.

The **cross-sectional** shape of a channel determines the amount of water in contact with the channel and the frictional drag.

The most efficient channels have the least perimeter for its cross-sectional area.

All other things equal, a stream with a smaller surface perimeter, the area where the water touches the ground, will have less friction and will flow faster. Consider the ratio of the area to the perimeter. Higher area, smaller perimeter = faster.

The size and roughness of the channel also contribute to friction, a smooth channel promotes a more uniform flow, water in an irregular channel can even form **rapids**, channels where turbulent flow extends up to the surface.

## Discharge and Changes Downstream

The **discharge** of a stream is the amount of water flowing past a certain point in a given amount of time.

Discharge is described by $\frac{m^{3}}{s}$

The stream will increase the size of its channel by widening and deepening it so that less waiter is in contact with the bed and banks of the channel.

Friction is reduced and the water flows faster.

In the headwaters region where the gradient is steepest, the water must flow in a relatively small and often boulder-strewn channel.

This creates drag and turbulent flow.

Downstream, the bed material becomes smaller, offering less resistance to flow,
and the width and depth of the channel increases to accommodate greater discharge.

These factors permit water to flow more freely and rapidly and compensate
for the decrease in gradient. A stream can therefore maintain a higher velocity
near its mouth than upstream because of the greater discharge, larger channel and smoother bed.

## Stream Erosion

Streams erode their channels mainly by the plucking of loosened particles from their beds and by abrasion.

Some erosion is also by the dissolution of soluble bedrock and channel debris.

Common features of some riverbeds are rounded depressions called **potholes**. They are created by the abrasive action of particles swirling in fast-moving eddies.

The rotational motion of the sand and pebbles acts like a drill to bore the holes.

## Dissolved Load

Most dissolved load is supplied by groundwater. As water percolates through the ground, it acquires soluble soil components, then ions, from deeper cracks and pores in bedrock.

Eventually, much of this ion-rich water finds its way into streams.

The velocity of stream flow has essentially no effect on a stream's ability to carry its dissolved loads.

## Suspended Load

Most streams carry the largest part of their load in **suspension**. The visible cloud of sediment suspended in the water is the most obvious portion of a stream's load.

During flood stage, larger particles are suspended as well. Then the total quantity of material carried in suspension increases dramatically.

The type and amount of material carried in suspension are controlled by two factors: the velocity of the water and the settling velocity of each sediment grain.

**Settling Velocity** = the speed which a particle falls through a stationary fluid. The larger the particle, the more rapidly it settles toward the streambed.

## Bed Load

Coarser particles move along the bed of the channel as **bed load**. The particles that make up the bed load move by rolling, sliding and saltation.

Sediment moving by **saltation**, leaping, appear to be jumping or skippnig along the streambed as particles are propelled upward by collisions or lifted by currents.

## Capacity and Competence

A stream's ability to carry solid particles is decribed by two criteria.

The **maximum load** of solid particles that a stream can transport per unit of time is termed its **capacity**. The greater the discharge, the greater is the stream's capacity for hauling sediment.

**Competence** of a stream is the maximum particle size that a stream can transport, based on its velocity. Fast streams have a greater competence than slower streams.

The increase in discharge results in greater capacity, the increased velocity produces greater competence.

With rising velocity the water becomes more turbulant.

## Deposition of Sediment By Streams

Whenever a stream's velocity slows, its competence is reduced and particles of sediment are deposited when their critical settling velocity is reached. This process called sorting, explains why particles of similar size are deposited together.
