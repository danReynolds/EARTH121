# Volcanoes

The primary factors for violent or gentle volcano eruptions is the magma's **composition**, **temperature**, and the amount of **dissolved gas** it contains.

These factors affect the magma's mobility, or viscosity.

Magma associated with an explosive eruption is much more viscous than magma extruded more gently.

## Factors Affecting Viscosity

Mobility of lava is strongly affected by temperature.

A major difference among various igneous rocks is their silica content. A magma's viscosity is directly related to its silica content.

The more silica in magma, the greater its viscosity. The flow of magma is impeded because structures link together into long chains, even before crystallization begins.

Because of high silica content, over 70%, felsic lavas are very viscous and form comparatively short, thick flows. By contrast, mafic lavas which contain 50% solica tend to be quite fluid and travel up to 150km before congealing.

Dissolved gases increase the fluidity of magma. On escape from the magma, gases provide enough force to rpopel magma from a volcanic vent, a surface opening or conduit.

The summits of volcanoes often begin to inflate months or years before an eruption as magma migrates into a reservoir within the cone.

During this phase, dissolved gases migrate upward and accumulate near the top of the magma chamber. When an eruption starts, gas-charged magma moves from the magma chamber and rises through the volcanic vent.
