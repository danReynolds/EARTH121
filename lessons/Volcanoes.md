# Volcanoes

The primary factors for violent or gentle volcano eruptions is the magma's **composition**, **temperature**, and the amount of **dissolved gas** it contains.

These factors affect the magma's mobility, or viscosity.

Magma associated with an explosive eruption is much more viscous than magma extruded more gently.

## Factors Affecting Viscosity

Mobility of lava is strongly affected by temperature.

A major difference among various igneous rocks is their silica content. A magma's viscosity is directly related to its silica content.

The more silica in magma, the greater its viscosity. The flow of magma is impeded because structures link together into long chains, even before crystallization begins.

Because of high silica content, over 70%, felsic lavas are very viscous and form comparatively short, thick flows. By contrast, mafic lavas which contain 50% solica tend to be quite fluid and travel up to 150km before congealing.

Dissolved gases increase the fluidity of magma. On escape from the magma, gases provide enough force to propel magma from a volcanic vent, a surface opening or conduit.

The summits of volcanoes often begin to inflate months or years before an eruption as magma migrates into a reservoir within the cone.

During this phase, dissolved gases migrate upward and accumulate near the top of the magma chamber. When an eruption starts, gas-charged magma moves from the magma chamber and rises through the volcanic vent.

**Mafic Magma** = at least 50% silica content, least viscous, least gas content. Form shield volcanoes, basalt plateaus, cinder cones.

**Andesitic Magma** = intermediate silica content ~60%. Viscosity intermediate, intermediate gas content. Form composite cones.

**Felsic Magma** = most silica content, ~70%, greatest viscosity, most gas content. Volcanic domes and pyroclastic flows.

Overall, the viscosity of magma, plus the quantity of dissolved gases and the ease with which they can escape determine the nature of a volcanic eruption.

## Materials Extruded during eruption

Volcanoes extrude lava, large volumes of gas, and pyroclastic materials like broken rock, lava bombs, fine ash and dust.

### Lava flows

Hot mafic lava is very fluid, flowing in thin broad sheets or streamlike ribbons. While mafic lava can get to 30km/h, silica-rich felsic lava moves too slowly to observe.

When fluid mafic lavas of the Hawaiian type congeal, they commonly form a smooth skin that wrinkles as the molten subsurface lava continues to move. These are called **pahoehoe** flows and resemble twisting braids in ropes.

Another common type of mafic lava is called **aa** which has a surface of rough, jagged blocks with dangerously sharp edges.

Gases escaping from the surface produce voids and sharp spines in the congealing lava.

When lava enters the ocean or when outpourings of lava actually originate underwater, the flow's outer skin congeals quickly, but the remaining mass breaks through the hardened surface. This process generates a pile of elongated structures resembling large pillows and called **pillows lava**.

Hardened lava flows contain tunnels that once were channels carrying lava from the volcanic vent to the flow's leading edge. The still molten lava within the conduits drains out the lower end, leaving behind the cavelike tunnels called lava tubes.

## Gases

Magma contains various volatiles held by confining pressure, which when pressure is reduced, escape.

The gases are about 70% water vapour, 15% CO2, and lesser amounts of sulphur, chlorine and fluorine.

Volcanoes are a natural source of air pollution. A single eruption can cause a haze of aerosols that will remain in the atmosphere for years, and lower the global temperature by nearly a degree.

Gases create conduits by high temperature buoyant forces from the rising magma crack the rock above. High-pressure gases expand the cracks and develop a passageway to the surface.

## Pyroclastic Materials

Mafic lava releases gases that propel lava to great heights. The ejected material can land near the vent and build cone-shaped structures.

Pyroclastic materials include the spewed ash, pumice, lapilli, cinders, blocks and bombs fragments that are ejected by gaseous, viscous magma.

When hot ash falls, glassy shards fuse to from welded tuff.

**Lapilli** are little stone pyroclasts that range form the size of small beads to walnuts.

Particles larger than 64mm in diameter are called blocks when they are made of hardened lava and bombs when they are ejected as incandescent lava.

**Scoria** = named applied to the vesicular, containing voids, ejecta derived from mafic magma. Black to reddish-brown fragments are found in the size range of lapilli.

When magma with an intermediate or silica-rich composition generates vesicular ejecta, it is called **pumice**.

Some pumice fragments have so many vesicles that they are light enough to float in water.

**nuees ardentes** = glowing avalanches, capable of racing down steep volcanic slopes at speeds that can exceed 100km per hour.


Sweep down slopes similar to an avalanche.

**Lahar** = mudflow which occurs when volcanic debris becomes saturated with water and rapidly moves down steep volcanic slopes.

Some lahars are triggered by large volumes of ice and snow which melt during an eruption, others are generated when heavy rainfall saturates weathered volcanic deposits.

## Anatomy of a volcano

Volcanic activity begins when a fissure develops in the crust as magma moves forcefully towards the surface. As the gas-rich magma moves up in this linear fissure, its path is localized into a circular conduit/pipe.

Successive eruptions of lava and pyroclastic material build the structure of a volcano.

Located at the summit of many volcanoes is a steep-walled depression called a crater with a cauldron shape. Craters are built upward as ejected fragments collect around the vent to form a doughnut-shaped structure.

Some have multiple craters, while others have large, circular depressions called **calderas**. A flank eruption, eruption from somewhere other than the volcanoes main vent, can result in a **parasitic cone** forming.

If these multiple vents only emit gases instead of pyroclastic material and lava, they are called **fumaroles**.

## Shield Volcanoes

Shield volcanoes are produced by the accumulation of fluid mafic lavals and are broad, slightly domed structures that resemble a shield.

Most shield volcanoes have grown up from the deep ocean floor to form islands or seamounts, such as Iceland.

A mature, active shield volcano has a steep-sided caldera that occupies its summit.

**Calderas** are formed at the top of a volcano when the rock above a magma chamber collapses, forming a cauldron-shaped impression. When a large magma chamber is emptied by an eruption, the unsupported rock at the top of the chamber collapses and falls, forming the bowl-shaped caldera.

## Cinder cones

Cinder cones are built from ejected lava fragments that harden while in flight. They range in size from fine ash to bombs but consist mostly of pea to walnut sized lapilli.

Cinder cones are composed mostly of loose pyroclastic material. Roughly symmetrical they are larger on the side that was downwind when the eruption occurred.

## Composite Volcanoes

Most picturesque, located in relatively narrow zone that rims the Pacific Ocean, called the Ring of Fire.

A composite volcano is a large, nearly symmetrical structure composed of both lava and pyroclastic deposits. Composite volcanoes are the product of gas-rich magma having an andesitic composition.

The growth of a typical composite volcano begins with both pyroclastic material and lava being emittd from a central vent. A typical conical shape with a steep summit area and gradually sloping flanks is created.

## Calderas

Calderas feature a slow upheaval, or resurgence of the floor of the caldera following an eruptive phase. These structures therefore consists of a large bowl-shaped circular depression containing a central elevated region.

## Fissure Eruptions and Lava plateaus

The greatest volume of volcanic material is extruded from fractures in the crust called **fissures**. These long, narrow cracks extrude low-viscosity mafic laval blanketing a wide area.

**Flood basalt** = massive buildup of basalt totaling hundreds to thousands of metres in thickness resulting from vertical stacking of lava flows emitted by blanketing fissure eruptions.

## Lava domes

Silica-rich lavas are so viscous they hardly flow. As thick lava is squeezed out of the vent, it may produce a steep-sided dome-shaped mass of congealed lava called a lava dome.

## Volcanic Pipes and Necks

Most volcanoes are fed magma through a short conduit called a pipe that connects a magma chamber to the surface.

In rare cases, deep ultramafic magmas migrate up to produce rocks that are though to be fairly pristine samples of the mantle.

This allows geologists to view rocks that normally are only found at great depths.

Volcanic pipes of depth 150km can be found, where pressure is high enough to generate diamonds.

## Volcanoes and Plate Tectonics

Most active volcanoes are near plate boundaries, oceanic ridges, subduction zones and in plate interiors above mantle plumes.
