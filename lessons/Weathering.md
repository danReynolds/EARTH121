# Weathering and Soil

Weathering, mass wasting and erosion are **external processes** because they occur at or near the Earth's surface and are powered by energy from the sun or Earth's gravity.

**Internal processes** include plate tectonics, mountain building and volcanic activity. Internal processes derive energy from Earth's interior.

1. **Weathering**: the physical breakdown and chemical alteration of rock at or near Earth's surface
2. **Mass wasting**: the transfer of rock and soil downslope by gravity
3. **Erosion**: the physical removal of material by water, ice, wind

**Mechanical Weathering** = otherwise called physical weathering, is accomplished by physical forces that break rock into smaller and smaller pieces without changing the rock's mineral composition. Ex. tearing paper

Three important physical processes lead to the fragmentation of rock:

1. Frost Wedging
2. Expansion resulting from unloading / Sheeting
3. Biologic activity

## Frost Wedging

Repeated freezing and thawing result in mechanical weathering. Water gets into rock and expands at it freezes, breaking the rock into angular fragments.

## Sheeting

When igneous rock is exposed by erosion, concentric slabs start breaking. The process generating these onion-like layers is called sheeting.

Continued weathering eventually causes the slabs to separate and flake away, creating an ex-foliation dome.

## Biologic activity

Plant roots and seedlings grow into and expand fractures. Lichens and moss attach themselves to bare rock, enhancing breakdown. Burrowing animals move fresh material to the surface, where it is exposed to the elements.

**Chemical Weathering** = involves a chemical transformation of rock into one or more new compounds. Ex. burning paper

Water is the most important agent of chemical weathering. Pure water is a good solvent. The main processes of chemical weathering are:

1. Dissolution
2. Oxidation
3. Hydrolysis

## Dissolution

Minerals can often dissolve in water. Additionally, the presence of any acid dramatically increases the corrosive force of water.

Carbonic acid is created when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in raindrops.

Sulfuric is introduced as acid rain and is produced by the weathering of pyrite and other sulphide minerals.

Hard water, for example, has active ions that react with soap to produce an insoluble material that renders soap nearly useless in removing dirt.

## Oxidation

Rusting occurs when oxygen combines with iron to form iron oxide.

The addition of water greatly increases the speed of rusting.

## Hydrolysis

The most common mineral group, the silicates is decomposed primarily by the process of hydrolysis, which is the reaction of any substance with water.

Hydrogen atoms attack and replace ions of the mineral, like potassium, and disrupt its crystalline network.

## Effects of Chemical Weathering

The most significant effect of chemical weathering is the decomposition of unstable minerals and the generation or retention of those materials that are stable at Earth's surface.

**Spheroidal weathering** = the process whereby angular rock fragments are attacked by water flowing through joints, rounding the corners and edges of the angular rocks into more spherical shapes.

## Rock Characteristics

Rock characteristics encompass all of the chemical traits of rocks, including mineral composition and solubility.

The variations of weathering rates because of mineral constituents can be demonstrated by comparing headstones made from different rock types.

Granite ones composed of silicate minerals are relatively resistant to chemical weathering, whereas marble headstones show signs of extensive chemical alteration over a short time.

Marble is composed of calcite, which readily dissolves in weak acidic solutions.

## Climate

Climate factors like temperature and moisture and critical to the rate of rock weathering. Regions with lush vegetation typically have a thick mantle of soil rich in decayed organic matter from which chemically active fluids containing carbonic acid and humic acid are derived.

The best environment for chemical weathering is warm temperatures with lots of moisture.

## Differential Weathering

Masses of rock do not weather uniformly, but unevenly. Differential weathering and subsequent erosion are responsible for creating many unusual and sometimes spectacular rock formations and landforms.

## Soil

Soil is the *bridge between life and the inanimate world*. Soil is a common boundary at which different parts of systems interact. It forms where the geo, atmos, and hydrospheres meet.

Much of Earth's surface is covered by **regolith**, the layer of rock and mineral fragments produced by weathering. Soil is a combination of mineral and organic matter, water, and air that supports the growth of plants and develops in place downward from the ground surface.

About one-half of the total volume of a good-quality soil is a mixture of disintegrated and decomposed rock and humus, the decayed remains of animal and plant life.

Humus is an important source of plant nutrients and it enhances the soil's ability to retain water. Because plants require air and water to live and grow, the portion of the soil consisting of pore spaces that allow for circulation of these elements is vital.
