# Crustal Deformation

## Structural Geology:

Structural geologists study the architecture of Earth's crust and the influence of deformation on that architecture. By studying the orientations of faults and folds, as well as small-scale features of deformed rocks, structural geologists can often reconstruct the original geologic setting and the nature of the forces that generated the rocks.

The basic geologic structures associated with deformation are:

* folds
* joints
* faults
* foliation

## Deformation

Every body of rock has a limit beyond which it will fracture of flow. **Deformation** refers to all changes in the original form of the rock, as well as its location and orientation.

Plate motions and the interactions along plate boundaries generate tectonic forces that cause rock units to deform.

### Force, Stress, and Strain

Geologists call stress the amount of force applied to a given area, so force distributed along an area.

### Types of Stress

1. **Differential Stress**: Stress applied unequally from different directions.
2. **Compressional Stress**: Differential stress that shortens a rock body. Compressional stress associated with plate collisions tend to shorten and thicken Earth's crust by folding and faulting.
3. **Tensional Stress**: When stress elongates or pulls apart a rock unit, such as when plate boundaries are diverging.

**Differential Stress** can cause rocks to **shear**, which can be thought of as the rock sliding in both directions, like pushing the top of a deck of cards one way and the bottom the other. Or a cube being transformed into a parallelepiped (3D rhombus).

In near-surface environments, shearing occurs on closely spaced parallel surfaces of weakness, such as bedding planes, foliation and microfaults.

At transform fault boundaries, shearing stresses produce large-scale offsets along major fault zones.

## How Rocks deform

When rocks are subjected to stresses greater than their own strength, they begin to deform usually by flowing or fracturing.

Rocks can be *bent* into intricate folds without being broken during the process.

When stress is gradually applied, rocks first respond by deforming elastically. Changes that result from elastic deformation are recoverable, and the rock can return to its original state like an elastic bouncing back into shape.

## Temperature and Confining Pressure

**Brittle Failure / Deformation** = Rocks near the surface where temperatures and pressures are low tend to be brittle and fracture once their strength is exceeded.

**Ductile Deformation** = at depth, where temperatures and confining pressures are high, rocks exhibit *ductile* behaviour that produces a change in the size and shape of the object without fracturing.

This can be achieved by gradual slippage and re-crystallization along planes of weakness within the crystal lattice of mineral grains.

This microscopic form of gradual solid-state flow involves slippage that disrupts the crystal lattice and immediate re-crystallization that repairs the structure.

### Rock type

1. Brittle rocks

Crystalline rocks composed of minerals that have strong internal molecular bonds tend to fail by brittle fracture.

Rocks that are brittle include quartzite, granite, and basalt.

2. Ductile rocks
Sedimentary rocks that are weakly cemented or metamorphic rocks that contain zones of weakness, such as foliation, experience more ductile flow.

Rocks that are ductile and are weakly bound enough to stretch and foliate include rock salt, gypsum, shale.

Rock salt is so weak hat it deforms under small amounts of differential stress and rises like stone pillars.

Glacial ice is the weakest naturally occurring solid to exhibit ductile flow on a large scale.

### Time

Rocks react differently to small amounts of stress applied over long periods of time.

Marble benches sag for example, under their own weight over a hundred years.

Forces that are unable to immediately deform rock can through prolonged stress cause a change.

## Mapping geologic structures

The process of deformation generates features at many different scales.

Highly localized stresses cause minor fractures in bedrock, for example, while large amounts of stress can upturn mountains.

These are all **rock structures**.

A number of mapping techniques enable geologists to reconstruct the orientation and shape of existing geologic structures.

This area has been aided by aerial photography, satellite and GIS imagery and GPS.

## Strike and dip

Geologists use measurements called strike and dip to help determine the orientation or attitude of a rock layer, join or fault surface.

By knowing the strike and dip of rocks at the surface, geologists can predict the nature and structure of rock units that are hidden beneath the surface.

**Strike** is the compass direction of the line produced by the intersection of an inclined rock layer or fault with a horizontal plane.

So intersect your rock with a hypothetical horizontal plane, and the line that the plane produces along the body of the rock is the **strike line**, then the angle that the line is cardinally is the value of this line of strike.

**Dip** is the angle of inclination of the rock from the hypothetical horizontal plane. So from the plane to the direction of the rock surface is its dip angle.

This data is plotted on a topographic map. By using this information, the geologists can reconstruct the pre-erosional structures and begin to interpret the region's geologic history.

## Folds

During mountain building, flat-lying sedimentary and volcanic rocks are often bent into a series of wavelike undulations called **folds**.

Folds in sedimentary strata resemble those that form when you push the ends of a piece of paper together.

Most folds result from compressional stresses that shorten and thicken the crust. Occasionally, the folds are found separate, but most often they occur together a series of waves and undulations.

The sides of a fold are called the limbs. A line drawn along the crest of the fold is termed the axis of the fold. In some folds, the axis is horizontal along or parallel to the surface, riding the crest. In more complex folding, the fold axis is often inclined at an angle known as the **plunge**. The **axial plane** is an imaginary surface that divides a fold as symmetrically as possible.

## Types of Folds

The two most common types of folds are called anti-cline and synclines. An **anticline** is most commonly formed by the up-folding or have been cut through deformed strata. Commonly found in association with anticlines are down-folds or troughs called **synclines**.

Notice that the limb of an anticline is also a limb of the adjacent syncline.

An asymmetric fold is said to be *overturned* if one limb is tilted beyond the vertical. An overturned fold can also lie on its side so that the axial plane of the fold would actually be horizontal.

These *recumbent* folds are common in mountainous regions like the Alps of Europe.

Folds are closely related to faults. Broad regional features called **monoclines** are large, step-like folds in otherwise horizontal sedimentary strata. These folds appear to be the result of the reactivation of steeply dipping fault zones located in basement rocks beneath the plateau.

As large blocks of basement rock were displaced upward along ancient faults, the comparatively ductile sedimentary strata above responded by folding.

## Domes and Basins

Broad up-wards in basement rock can deform the overlying cover of sedimentary strata and generate large folds.

When this up-warping produces a circular or elongate structure, the feature is called a **dome**. Down-warped structures having a similar shape are termed **basins**.

Domes can also be formed by the intrusion of magma (laccoliths). In addition, the upward migration of salt formations can produce domes.

Because large basins contain sedimentary beds sloping at such low angles, they are usually identified by the age of the rocks composing them.

The youngest rocks are found near the center, and the oldest are on the flanks. This is the opposite of a dome, where the oldest rocks form the core. Makes sense, gravity.

## joints

Among the most common rock structures resulting from brittle deformation are fractures called **joints** along which no appreciable displacement has occurred.

Although some joints have a random orientation, most occur in roughly parallel groups.

Most joints are produced when rocks in the outermost crust are deformed. Tensional and shearing stresses cause the rock to fail by brittle structure.

When folding occurs, rocks situated at the axes of the folds are elongated and pulled apart to produce tensional joints. Extensive joint patterns can also develop in response to relatively subtle and often barely perceptible, regional up-warping and down-warping of the crust.
