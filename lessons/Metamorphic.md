# Metamorphism

Metamorphism, meaning to change form, occurs under extreme conditions, almost always deep below the Earth's surface.

Understanding of these rocks is built on observations of ancient metamorphic rocks and experiments conducted in special high-temperature, high-pressure laboratories.

Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is subjected to temperatures or pressures markedly different from those in which it originally formed.

These changes happen in a solid state, although hot fluids migrating through the rock may play a key role in the process.

The type and degree of change in transformation of the *parent rock* to a metamorphic rock depends on the type and intensity of the process.

## Controlling Factors

The chemical composition of a metamorphic rock reflects that of its parent rock, but the **texture** and *specific mineral makeup* of the rock depends on the particular physical processes involved in the transformation.

The main factors are:

1) Heat: Heat drives the basic chemical reactions that transform minerals into new forms, and influences the mobility and reactivity of chemically active fluids.

Heat can be given off by an intrusive igneous body that bakes the surrounding rocks. It can also cook rocks using Earth's internal heat, the geothermal gradient.


2) Pressure: Pressure influences the temperature at which certain minerals are stable and plays a role in dictating the distribution of elements within a metamorphic rock.

**Confining Pressure** = or uniform stress, circle, involves the squeezing of a rock in all directions, confining the material into the smallest possible volume with no change in shape. Water pressure is an example of confining pressure, and both increase with depth.

At great depth, confining pressure can force mineral grains to crowd together and crystal arrangements to become more compact.

Pressure alone will just form metamorphic rock that is harder and denser and contains new minerals but are otherwise similar in appearance to the parent rock.

**Directed pressure** = or differential stress, oval, refers to the unequal application of pressure, resulting in the distortion of a body. Within Earth, directed pressure is associated with horizontal shortening and stretching of Earth's crust caused by plate tectonic activity.

Three basic types of directed pressure:

* Compressional stress: Pushing together motion and results in crustal shortening
* Tensional stress: involves a pulling apart motion that results in crustal stretching
* Shear stress: forces are parallel but are in opposite directions, causing layers of material to slide parallel to one another.

At the surface, temperatures are low and rocks are brittle and tend to fracture when subjected to directed pressure. In higher temperature environments, rocks are ductile, meaning that the mineral grains tend to flatten or elongate when subjected to directed pressure, allowing the rocks to flow rather than fracture.

The majority of metamorphic rocks affected by directed pressure show evidence of ductile deformation.

The results of directed pressure and ductile deformation are manifested in folds and other structures found in many metamorphic rocks. However, on a much smaller scale, directed pressure also greatly affects the texture of metamorphic rocks. Under directed pressure, platy sheet-like to tablet-shaped and elongate grains of mineral tend to become aligned so that they are oriented parallel to the direction of minimum stress.

So like if you sit on a leaf, it lays flat. It is positioned parallel to the direction of least stress. In rocks, this is fittingly called **foliation**, meaning leaf. Three factors influence the development of foliation:

* Rotation of platy/elongate grains into a new orientation
* Changing the shape of equidimensional grains into elongate shapes that are aligned in a preferred orientation.
* Re-crystallization of minerals to form new grains growing in the direction of preferred orientation

The rotation of existing mineral grains is the easiest of the mechanisms involved. The new alignment is parallel to the direction of least stress and perpendicular to the direction of maximum stress.

Grain elongation, another factor that can impart a foliated appearance to a rock, results from internal deformation along planes within the crystal structure of mineral grains.

Re-crystallization involves the creation of new mineral grains from old ones. In some cases, mineral components can be dissolved, transported to a different site and re-precipitated on other mineral grains. In others, re-crystallization the mass transfer of mineral material from highly stressed to less stressed areas.

In both cases, crystal grow is focused in the direction of least stress, resulting in the preferred orientation of mineral grains. As discussed further, these mechanisms are greatly aided by chemically active fluids.

3) Chemically active fluids: At depth, hot water is released into surrounding rocks when a magma body cools and solidifies. Clay minerals, micas and amphiboles are hydrated. Elevated temperatures and pressures cause these minerals to dehydrate, expelling hot, cation-laden water.

Resulting chemically active fluids transport ions from one site in the crystal to another, facilitating re-crystallization.

If rocks that surround a pluton are chemically different from fluids expelled by the pluton, there will likely be an exchange between the fuids and the host rock, changing the chemical composition of the rocks.

This process is called *metasomatism*.

## Metamorphic Grade and Index Materials

Metamorphic rocks are often described in terms of their **metamorphic grade**, or the intensity of metamorphism that they experienced.

An increase in metamorphic grade is indicated by the sequential appearance of minerals that are stable at progressively higher temperatures and in some cases, progressively higher pressures.

Some metamorphic minerals form and remain stable within relatively narrow, well-defined ranges of pressure and temperature. SOme of these minerals are used as **index minerals** to define the grade of a metamorphic rock.

For example, the mineral *chlorite*, begins to form at relatively low temperatures, cooler than 200C. Rocks that contain chlorite are therefore called **low grade** metamorphic rocks.

At the opposite end, the mineral *sillimanite* forms only in extreme environments where temperatures exceeds 600C, therefore rocks containing sillimanite are called **high-grade**.

**Intermediate grade** metamorphic rocks record conditions between these opposite ends of the spectrum and can contain metamorphic minerals such as biotite and garnet.

## Burial Metamorphism

Involves the mild alteration of rock by an increase in temperature and confining pressure and essentially viewed as a step beyond sediment diagenesis. Such conditions are met in the deepest areas of sedimentary basins, ocean trenches and passive margins where geothermal heat is sufficient to re-crystallize minerals in sedimentary parent rock to form low-grade metamorphic minerals such as zeolites and chorite.

As a result of increased confining pressure and minimal directed pressure, rocks become denser but are not distorted.

They therefore resemble rocks affected by low-temperature contact metamorphism. The effects of this type of metamorphism can be so mild that such features as bedding and grain size variations are preserved.

On average, low-grade metamorphism usually begins at depths of about 8km, where temperatures can reach up to 200C.

## Contact metamorphism

Occurs when rocks immediately surrounding an igneous body are cooked and altered from their original state. The altered rocks define a zone called an **aureole**, meaning a golden halo and small intrusions such as dykes and sills typically form aureoles only a few cm thick.

Larger intrusions such as batholiths can produce aureoles that extend outward for several km.

Although contact metamorphism is not entirely restricted to shallow crustal depths, it is most easily recognized when it has occurred near the surface. Here, the temperature contract between the intrusion and the host rock is greatest and the confining pressure is low.

Metamorphic rocks produced by contact metamorphism are typically non-foliated, so not expanding parallely like a leaf, because contact metamorphism involves the simple baking of a parent rock in the absence of directed pressure.

Resulting random crystal orientation is most obvious in metamorphic rocks that contain many platy or elongate mineral crystals. Parent rocks that produce these minerals when metamorphosed include sedimentary mudrocks, such as shale, and mafic igneous rocks such as basalt. Heating can both transform clay minerals of shale into platy micas.

In some cases, large grains of metamorphic minerals called porphyroblasts impart a spotted **porphyroblastic texture** to the rock. A distinguishing feature of this texture is that neither the blasts nor the platy/elongate crystals exhibit preferred orientation.

A zone of high-grade metamorphic rocks like garnet and sillimanite would be expected to lie within a metamorphic aureole near the central intrusion, while a zone of low grade containing chlorite would be near the aureole's outer edge.

Not all parent rocks contain mineral components to produce platy and elongate minerals and a number of other nonfoliated metamorphic rock types can result from contact metamorphism, including quartzite = contact metamorphism of quartz sandstone, hornfels, marble = contact metamorphism of limestone.

Although quartzite and marble are commonly associated with contact metamorphism, they are not diagnostic of this type of metamorphism.

## Regional Metamorphism

The majority of metamorphic rocks observed on Earth can be attributed to **regional metamorphism**. This type of metamorphism occurs over a wide area and is closely tied to the increased pressures and temperatures associated with convergent plate boundaries.

During convergence, large segments of Earth's crust are squeezed horizontally, imposing a substantial directed pressure. AS the rocks are deformed, the crust is shortened and thickened, like a rumpled carpet.

The thickening causes crust above sea-level to be pushed up to form mountains and crust below sea level to be forced downward to form the roots of mountains.

Rocks are subjected to elevated temperatures that accompany both deep burial and the emplacement of magma from the mantle.

The intensity of regional metamorphism becomes greatest when continents collide. The cores of many mountain ranges that result from continental collission consist of folded and faulted metamorphic rock, commonly intermixed with intruded igneous rocks.

As these deformed rock masses are uplifted, erosion removes the overlying material to expose the igneous and metamorphic rocks that compose the central core of the range.

As with contact metamorphism, the rocks that best display the effects of regional metamorphism are those containing lots of platy or elongate mineral grains, whose orientations provide clues to the nature of pressure applied.

The increased intensity of directed pressure that accompanies increasing temperature and confining pressure causes platy and elongate minerals to attain a preferred orientation.

Foliated rocks are therefore characteristic of regional metamorphism.

The metamorphism of shale is emphasized in this section because it is widespread and contains the necessary chemical ingredients to produce the platy and elongate mineral crystals that best define foliation.

 In regional metamorphism, metamorphic index minerals and texture change with increasing temp and pressure, whereas temperature is the main factor influencing metamorphic grade in contact metamorphism.

 ## Regional Metamorphism of Shale

 Here we track the transition of shale into the metamorphic rock slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss.

 **Slate** is a very fine-grained foliated rock primarily composed of mica flakes that are too small to be seen.

 It is produced by the low-grade metamorphism of clay-rich mudrocks like shale, or volcanic ash.

 Looks similar, but is harder and has a slight sheen. Because of the preferred orientation of platy minerals in the direction of weakest stress, slate develops **rock cleavage** which allows it to be broken into very think, flat slabs.

**Phyllite** is another low-grade metamorphic rock produced at a slightly higher temperature and pressure than slate. Its constituent platy minerals are larger than those of slate, giving it a glossy sheen, but are still too small to be seen by the unaided eye.

Phyllite also exhibits rock cleavage, but the cleavage surfaces have a slightly wavy appearance, reflecting the higher degree of directed pressure.

**Schist** = Medium to coarse-grained metamorphic rock dominated by platy mica minerals large enough to be seen by the unaided eye. Medium metamorphic grade, one step higher than phyllite. Platy minerals have an obvious preferred orientation that defines a distinctive schistose foliation or **schistosity**.

Contains smaller amounts of blocky and tabular minerals, such as feldspar and can also contain elongate grains of minerals, such as amphibole.

Depending on the intensity of metamorphism and composition of parent rocks, mica schists commonly contain accessory minerals like garnet, staurolite, sillimanite.

**Gneiss** = medium to coarse-grained banded metamorphic rock in which granular and elongate minerals predominate. High metamorphic grade. Most common minerals in gneiss are quartz, potassium feldspar, and sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar.

During high-grade metamorphism, the light and dark components separate into layers, giving gneisses their characteristic banded or layered appearance, called **gneissic texture**, or gneissosity.

Most gneisses consist of alternating bands of white or pink feldspar-rich zones and layers of dark ferromagnesian minerals. These banded gneisses commonly show evidence of deformation.

Gneiss forms from the high-grade metamorphism of shale and represents the highest grade reached by such rocks during regional metamorphism before the onset of melting. Like schists, gneisses can also include large crystals of metamorphic minerals, such as garnet and staurolite.

## Regional Metamorphism of Basalt

Unlike shale, which is primarily composed of hydrous clay minerals, basalt is predominately composed of anhydrous minerals. A basalt parent rock produces different mineral assemblages, and different types of metamorphic rock.

The metamorphic rocks derived from basalt have a higher abundance of minerals containing iron and magnesium than those derived from  mudrocks. It is only at low metamorphic grades that platy mineral grains are sufficiently abundant to produce obvious foliation.

At medium to high metamorphic grades, the foliation in basalt-derived metamorphic rocks tend to be less pronounced than in mudrock-derived metamorphic rocks because the foliation is defined by the preferred orientation of elongate crystals.

**Greenschist** = At low grades of metamorphism, ferromagnesian minerals contained in the parent basalt are hydrated to form minerals such as chlorite. Chlorite imparts both a phyllite-like foliation and a green colour to the rock.

**Amphibolite** = When subjected to higher temperatures and pressures, chlorite and associated hydrated minerals lose water and are converetd to amphiboles. The resulting rock is of equivalent metamorphic grade to the schist produced from a shale parent.

**Granulite** = At even higher temperatures and pressures, the amphibole minerals contained in amphibolite are further dehydrated to produce pyroxenes and garnets. The high-grade metamorphic rock thus produced called granulite is equivalent to gneiss produced from mudrock parents but has a very coarse-grained granular texture.

## Upper Limit of Regional Metamorphism

In the extreme environments in regional metamorphism, rocks begin to partially melt and pass into a transition zone between metamorphism and the igneous realm.

Part of the rock remains solid and can be considered part of the metamporphic process, but part of it is melted to form magma. Rocks called **migmatites** represent this state and include both igneous and metamorphic components.

They are generally included in metamorphic rocks because they represent the very last possible step a metamorphic rock can take in its passage through conditions of progressively higher temperature and pressure.

## Regional Metamorphism and Nonfoliated Rocks

The fact that many rocks produced by the regional metamorphism are foliated does not mean that all of them show this texture, because some parent rocks lack the elements to produce the platy or elongate mineral grains that define foliation.

Such minerals as quartz and calcite occur in various shapes and do not define a foliation as readily as micas.

## Subduction Zone Metamorphism

Technically a form of regional metamorphism but is discussed here in a separate category because of the special conditions involved. Metamorphism in the region of a subducted slab is characterized by very high pressures and low temperatures.

Rocks lying on both sides of the plate boundary are affected. Because a subducted oceanic slab is cold and is a poor heat conductor, rocks on the top of the slab and on the underside encounter a large increase in pressure at a rapid rate but remain relatively cool.

Under these conditions, a peculiar, sodium-rich, blue-coloured amphibole forms, called glaucophane.

Because of the preferred orientation of elongate glaucophane grains, the rock exhibits foliation and is called blueschist.

Continued subduction drags rocks into the mantle where the blueschist is further transformed into a rock called eclogite.

## Metamorphic Facies and Plate Tectonics

**Metamorphic facies** are defined by a distinctive assemblage of minerals that can be used to designate a particular set of metamorphic environmental conditions recorded in the rocks.

An advantage of this scheme is that rocks produced by different types of metamorphism can be interpreted within a single, unified context.
