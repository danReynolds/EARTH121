# What is Sedimentary Rock?

Weathered debris is moved from bedrock, carried away and deposited.

As piles of sediment accumulate, the materials near the bottom are compacted. Over long periods, these sediments become cemented together by mineral matter deposited in the spaces between particles, forming rock.

Accounts for about 5% of all rock in the outer 16km.

It is relatively thin and found on the upper portion of the crust.

Sedimentary rocks contain fossils, and other clues about where they came from and how they were transported.

**Diagenesis** = collective term for all of the chemical, physical and biologic changes that take place after sediments are deposited but before metamorphism.

Diagenesis occurs within the upper few kilometres of Earth's crust.

**Re-crystallization** is one example of diagenetic change, the development of more stable minerals from less stable ones.

Aragonite for example is the less stable form of calcium carbonate, calcite.

Diagenesis includes **lithification**, the process by which unconsolidated sediments are transformed into solid sedementary rock. Basic lithification processes include compaction and cementation.

**Compaction**: The deeper sediment is buried, the more compact it becomes. As the grains are pressed closer together, there is a reduction in **pore space**, the space between rock particles or within rock fractures, as well as loss of fluids.

**Cementation**: The most important process by which sediments are converted to sedimentary rock. It is a chemical diagenetic change that involves the precipitation of minerals among the individual sediment grains. The cementing materials are carried in solution by water percolating through pore spaces between particles.

The cement ultimately precipitates onto the sediment grains, filling pore spaces and joining with the existing particles.

Calcite, silica and iron oxide are the most common cements.

## Sedimentary Environments

**Environment of deposition** or **Sedimentary Environment** = a geographic setting where sediment is accumulating. Each site is characterized by a particular combination of geologic processes and environmental conditions.

## Types of Environments

### Continental Environments

Continental environments are dominated by the erosion and position associated with streams. Materials deposited directly from ice are are typically poorly sorted mixtures of particles that range in size from clay to boulders. Water from melting glaciers transports and re-deposits glacial sediment.

Streams erode more land and transport and deposit more sediment than any other process.

Where streams emerge from a mountainous area onto a flatter surface, coarse-grained sediment sourced from nearby highlands accumulate at the toe of the slope to form a distinctive cone-shaped feature called an **alluvial fan**.

**Floodplains** = lowlands where mud and sand settle out from the floodwaters of flat areas.

**Aeolian Sediments** = sediment left by wind, named after Aeolus, Greek god of wind.

Can result in formation of **dunes**. Deserts and coasts are common sites for this type of deposition.

Desert basins are the sites at which shallow **playa lakes** form, rapidly drying up and leaving behind mudflats.

### Transitional Environments

Characterized by low gradients or quiet water conditions, fine-grained sediment may be deposited under shallow sheets of water and exposed to air, producing mud-dominated **tidal flats**.

Alternatively, sediment delivered to the sea by streams can be repeatedly sorted and deposited to produce a sand or gravel beach, or when waves redistribute the sediment, produce spits, bars, and barrier islands.

A sheltered, brackish (slightly-salty), calm-water are called a lagoon and may form behind an offshore bar or reef.

Deltas are the most important type of deposit of transitional environments, the complex accumulations of sediment build outward into the sea when rivers experience a loss of velocity and drop their load on detritus.

### Marine Environments

Marine depositional environments are divided according to depth. The shallow marine environments reach to depths of 200 metres and extend from the shore tot he outer edge of the continental shelf.

The deep marine environments lies seaward of the continental shelf in waters deeper than 200 metres.

On average the shallow marine zones that surround the continents are about 80 kilometres.

The kind of sediment deposited depends on distance from shore, elevation of adjacent land area, water depth, water temperature, salinity and climate.

Shallow marine environments have lots of land-derived sediment. Influx of such sediment is small and the seas are relatively warm. Coral reefs are found in this warm, shallow marine environment.

Deep marine environments take a long time to form, accumulating small grains of sediment on the ocean floor slowly.

## Sedimentary Facies

Different sediments are accumulating adjacent to one another at the same time. Each unit possesses a distinctive set of characteristics reflecting the conditions in a particular environment.

These sets of sediments are called sedimentary facies.

## Types of Sedimentary Rock

Sediment has three principal sources:

1. **Detrital Sedimentary Rocks** = Originates as solid particles derived from both mechanical and chemical weathering of existing rocks. Deposits of this type are termed detrital.

2. **Chemical Sedimentary Rocks** = Soluble material produced largely by chemical weathering. These dissolved substances are precipitated by either inorganic or organic processes.

3. **Organic Sedimentary Rock** = Organic matter derived from carbon-rich tissues of once-living things like plants can accumulate to produce coal.

## Detrital Sedimentary Rocks

Usually formed from clay and quartz minerals, these rocks can also be referred to as *siliciclastic*.

Other common minerals in detrital rocks are feldspars and micas. Particle size is the primary basis for distinguishing different detrital rocks.

Common detrital sedimentary rocks are mudrocks, sandstone, and breccia.

## Shale and other mudrocks

**Mudrocks** = group of sedimentary rocks including shale, mudstone, siltstone, account for more than half of all sedimentary rock. Particles in these types of rocks are so small that they cannot be readily identified without strong magnification.

Mudrocks are more difficult to study and analyze than most other sedimentary rocks.

Environments include lakes, river fllodplains, lagoons and portions of the deep ocean basin. As silt and clay accumulate, they tend to form thin layers called **laminae**.

Shales are often weak because they are poorly cemented and are not well lithified.

Shale is often used to refer to all fine-grained sedimentary rock. Shale itself is a type of mudrock that can be split into thin layers. This property is called **fissility**.

A fine-grained rock that is often grouped with shale but lacks fissility is siltstone, which is composed largely of silt-sized particles and contains less clay-sized material than shale and mudstone.

### Sandstone

Name given to rocks in which sand-size grains dominate. After shale, sandstone is the most abundant sedimentary rock, accounting for 20% of the entire group.

Sandstones form in a variety of environments and contain clues about their origin including sorting, particle shape and composition.

**Sorting** = the degree of similarity in particle size in a sedimentary rock. For example, if all the grains in a sample of sandstone are about the same size, the sand is considered well-sorted. While if the rock is a mixture of large and small particles, the sand is poorly sorted.

Sediment accumulation that exhibits poor sorting usually results when particles are transported for only a relatively short time and then rapidly deposited.

When a turbulent stream reaches the gentler slopes at the base of a steep mountain, its velocity is quickly reduced and poorly sorted sands and gravels are deposited.

The **roundness** of sand grains, reflecting the degree to which corners and edges of grains have been smoothed down, can also help decipher the history of a sandstone.

When streams, winds or waves move sand and other particles, the grains collide with other particles during transport, wearing them down.

The degree of rounding reflects the distance, time, or repetition of disturbance involved in the transportation of sediment by currents of air or water. Highly rounded grains = lots of transport and abrasion.

Very angular grains indicate the materials were transported only a short distance before they were deposited, and that some other medium may have transported them.

When glaciers move sediment, the particles can be made more irregular by the crushing of colliding particles near the base of the glacier.

A sandstone containing a lot of feldspar and angular grains of ferromagnesian minerals underwent little chemical weathering and transport.

Owing to its durability, quartz is the pre-dominant mineral in most sandstones. When this is the case, the rock may be called quartz sandstone.

Another variety of sandstone is **wacke**, along with quartz and feldspar, this dark-coloured rock contains rock fragments and matrix.

**Matrix** = silt and clay-sized particles found in spaces between larger sand grains. More than 15% of a wacke's volume is matrix. The poor sorting and angular grains of wacke suggest that particles were transferred only a short distance from the source area and the rapidly deposited.

## Conglomerate and Breccia

Conglomerate consists of rounded pebbles and cobbles. These particles can range in size from large boulders to particles as small as garden peas.

The particles are commonly large enough to be identified as distinctive rock types. Many conglomerates are poorly sorted because they have large trapped mud and sand.

Coarse particles in a conglomerate may reflect the action of energetic mountain streams or strong wave activity along a rapidly eroding rocky coast.

If large particles are angular rather than rounded, the rock is called **breccia**.

Because large particles abrade and become rounded very rapidly during transport, the pebbles and cobbles in breccia indicate that they did not travel far from their source area before they were deposited.

Therefore like other sedimentary rocks, conglomerates and breccias contain clues about their history. The particle sizes reveal the strength of the currents that transported them, whereas the degree of rounding indicates how fara or long the particles travelled.

## Chemical Sedimentary Rocks

Chemical sediments derive from material that is carried *in solution* to lakes and seas, where some of it precipitates to form chemical sediments.

These become rocks such as limestone, rock salt and potash. Precipitation occurs in two ways:

1. Inorganic processes like evaporation and chemical activity

2. Organic life processes where aquatic organisms form chemical sediments of bio-chemical origin.

One example of inorganic precipitation is the dripstone that decorates many caves and another is the salt left behind as a body of seawater evaporates.

With organic precipitation, water-dwelling animals and plants extract dissolved mineral matter to form shells and other hard parts. After the organisms die, their skeletons collect by the millions on the floor of a lake or ocean as bio-chemical sediment.
