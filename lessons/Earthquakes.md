# Earthquakes

An earthquake is the vibration of Earth produced by the rapid release of energy. Most often caused by slippage along faults in the Earth's crust.

**Hypocentre** = source from which all energy is released and radiates in all directions in the form of seismic waves

An earthquake generates seismic waves that radiate throughout earth.

**Epicentre** = location on the surface directly above the Hypocentre

## Elastic Rebound

Tectonic forces slowly deform crustal rocks on both sides of a fault and build up elastic energy, much like a stick if bent. Eventually, the frictional resistance holding the rocks together is overcome. A slippage occurs at the weakest point, the hypocentre, displacement exerts stress farther along the fault, where additional slippage occurs.

This slippage allows rocks to *snap back*, the vibrations we feel occur as the rock elastically returns to its original shape. The springing back of the rock is called **elastic rebound**. The rebound/snap back means that at first we have a straight line, then they become warped, one half going up, another down, to form an S-shape, then when they eventually snap, and release all that energy, we get a straight line again. It snaps back into a straight line, but now offset.

Most earthquakes are produced by the rapid release of elastic energy stored in the rock that has been subjected to great stress.

## Foreshocks and Aftershocks

The adjustments that follow a major earthquake often generate smaller earthquakes called **aftershocks**.

Small earthquakes called **foreshocks** often precede a major earthquake by days or even years.

## Seismology

The study of earthquake waves. Modern **seismographs** record seismic waves. They have a mass freely suspended from a support that is attached to the ground.

When the vibration from a distant earthquake reaches the instrument, the **inertia** of the mass keeps it relatively stationary while Earth and the recording drum and support move. The movement of Earth in relation to the stationary mass is recorded on a rotating drum, magnetic tape, etc.

Seismic waves radiate outwards in all directions from the point of focus.

The wave types that travel through Earth's interior are called **body waves**. The types that travel along the outer part of Earth are called **surface waves**. Body waves are further divided into two types:

1. **Primary waves**

P waves are push-pull waves, pushing and pulling rocks in the direction the wave is travelling, like holding a person and shaking them towards and away from you.

Solids, liquids, and gases resist a change in volume when compressed and will elastically spring back once force is removed. This makes P waves compressional waves and able to travel through all materials.

2. **Secondary waves**

S waves shake the particles at right angles to the direction of travel. Gases and liquids do not respond elastically to S waves.

Surface waves have both a vertical and horizontal motion and the latter horizontal motion is especially damaging to structures.

P waves travel 1.7 times as fast as S waves, and S waves travel 1.1 times as fast as surface waves.

S waves have a greater amplitude than P waves, while surface waves tend to have the greatest amplitude.

Surface waves have the longest period and are also referred to as **long waves** or **L waves**.

## Locating the source

Greater the time between arrival of P wave and S wave, greater the distance from the source.

The distance and direction can then be determined. The precise location can be found using a triangulation when the distance is known from three or more different seismic stations.

## Earthquake Belts

95% of the energy released by earthquakes originate in a few relatively narrow zones that wind around the globe.

The greatest energy is released along a path around the outer edge of the Pacific Ocean called the *circum-Pacific belt* including Japan, the Phillipines.

Another major region is through the mountainous regions adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and through Iran.

In North America, there is the belt adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.

## Measuring the Size

Historically, there are two factors for determining the size of an earthquake:

1. Intensity: A measure of the degree of earthquake shaking at a given locale based on the amount of damage

2. Magnitude:

The quantitative measure used to describe intensity is the **magnitude**, which relies on calculations that use data provided by seismic records to estimate the energy released.

## Intensity Scales

At one time historical records provided the only accounts of the severity of earthquake shaking and destruction.

A scale was developed called the **Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale**, for example, if some wooden structures are destroyed by an earthquake, that earthquake would be given an intensity X on the scale.

Not objective, dependent on building design and population density.

## Magnitude Scales

**Richter Scale** is based on the amplitude of the largest seismic wave (P, S or surface) recorded on a seismogram.

Because seismic waves weaken as the distance between the earthquake epicentre and the seismograph increases, Richter developed a method that accounted for the decrease in wave amplitude with increased distance.

Measuring stations at different locations around the world should receive the same Richter magnitude, but it does vary because of rock type slightly.

No upper limit to the scale, but largest ever recorded was 8.9.

32-fold energy marginal increase, 10-fold amplitude marginal increase on the scale.

## Moment Magnitude

Moment magnitude is calculated using a combination of factors that include the average amount of displacement along the fault, the area of the rupture surface, and the shear strength of the faulted rock.

Estimates the total energy released and is better for measuring very large earthquakes.

## Earthquake destruction

Many factors determine the degree of destruction that will accompany an earthquake. The most obvious is the magnitude of the earthquake and its proximity to a populated area. Most earthquakes are small and occur in remote regions.

### Destruction from Seismic vibrations

The amount of structural damage attributable to the vibrations of an Earthquake depends on:

1. The intensity of the vibrations
2. The duration of the vibrations
3. The nature of the material on which the structure rests
4. The design of the structure


### Amplification of Seismic waves

The destruction can vary considerably because soft sediments amplify vibrations more than solid bedrock.

### Liquefaction

In areas where unconsolidated materials are saturated with water, earthquake vibrations can generate a phenomenon called **liquefaction**. Under these conditions, what had been a stable soil turns into a mobile fluid that is not capable of supporting buildings or other structures.

## Tsunami

Most tsunami result from the vertical displacement along a fault that lifts a large slab of sea floor. Once created, a tsunami resembles the ripples formed when a pebble is dropped into a pond.

Tsunamis advance at about 800km/h. A tsunami in the open ocean can pass undetected because its height is usually less than 1 metre and the distance between wave crests ranges from 100km to 700km. On entering shallow coastal water, these destructive waves are slowed down and the water begins to pile up to heights that can exceed 30m.

## Landslides and Ground Subsidence

The greatest damage to structures can be from the landslides and ground subsidence triggered by vibrations.

## Fire

Earthquakes can sever gas and electrical lines, igniting structures.

## Short-Range Predictions

Precursors are phenomena that precede and provide a warning of an imminent earthquake.

In California, seismologists are measuring uplift, subsidence and strain in the rocks near active faults.

## Long-Range Forecasts

Long-range forecasts give the probability of a certain magnitude earthquake occurring on a time scale of 30-100 years.

Long-range forecasts assume that earthquakes are repetitive or cyclic, like the weather.

As soon as one earthquake is over, the continuing motions of Earth's plates begin to build stress in the rocks again until they fail.

When researchers studied historical records, they discovered that some zones had not produced a great earthquake in more than a century. These quiet zones are called **seismic gaps** and are probable sites for major earthquakes in the next few decades.

Another method of long-term forecasting called **paleoseismology** studies layered deposits that were offset by prehistoric seismic disturbances. Researchers recently discovered strong evidence that the Pacific Northwest must be prepared.

## Probing Earth's Interior

Wells drilled into the crust in search of oil, gas and other natural resources have been confined to the upper 7km. Even the deepest well has only done ~12km.

Fortunately, as seismic waves pass through the Earth, they carry info to the surface about the materials through which they were transmitted.

When carefully analyzed, the seismic records provide an image of materials below the surface.

Because the time required for P and S waves to travel through Earth depends on the properties of the materials encountered, seismologists search for variations in travel times that cannot be accounted for by varying distances.

To obtain accurate travel times, seismologists need to know the exact location and time of an earthquake.

Using nuclear explosions, seismologists were able to determine the finer structures of Earth's interior.

## The Nature of Seismic waves

The velocity of seismic waves depends on the density and elasticity of the medium.

Seismic waves travel mostly in rigid materials that elastically spring back to their original shapes when stress caused by a wave is removed.

Crystalline rock, for example, transmits waves more rapidly than a layer of unconsolidated mud.

Within a given layer, the speed of seismic waves generally increases with depth because pressure increases and squeezes the rock into more compact elastic material.

P waves can propagate through liquids as well as solids because when compressed these materials behave elastically.

S waves cannot propagate through liquids because unlike solids, liquids have no shear strength. When liquids are subjects to forces that act to change their shape, they just change shape.

When seismic waves change medium, the path of the wave is refracted.

Seismic waves speed up or slow down and can be refracted or reflected when they cross the boundary between two mediums.

## Seismic Waves and Earth's structure

If Earth were a perfectly homogeneous body, seismic waves would spread through it in all directions.

Waves generally speed up as they move away from the epicentere, because at greater depth, there is increased pressure, enhancing the elastic properties of deeply buried rock and allowing P waves to travel faster.

## Discovering Earth's Major Boundaries

From global seismic data, seismologists have developed a detailed image of the Earth's interior.

### The Crust-Mantle boundary

**Moho** boundary, found that P waves moved faster to certain places rather than others. Concluded that below 50km, a layer exists with properties markedly different from those of the crust.

### Core-Mantle boundary

German seismologist discovered another major boundary, based on the observation that P waves diminish and die out completely about 100 degrees from an earthquake. Then about 140 degrees, they re-appear, but 2 minutes later than expected.

This belt, where seismic waves are absent, is about 40 degrees wide and has been named the **P-wave shadow zone**. The P-wave shadow zone could be explained if Earth contained a core that was composed of material unlike the overlying mantle. The core hinders the transmission of P waves.

The shadow zone bends the P waves, which enter the core. S waves do not travel through the core, meaning that at least a p0ortion of this region is liquid.

P-wave velocities also drop suddenly when they enter the core, which would make sense because melting reduces the elasticity of rock, and a liquid layer below the mantle, a liquid core, would explain these observations.

### Discovery of the Inner Core

A core was discovered within the core. The size of the **inner core** was not precisely established until the 60s, when nuclear tests were conducted in Nevada. The exact location and time of the explosions were known, so echoes from seismic waves that bounced off the inner core were measured precisely and allowed us to determine the inner core's size.

The inner core has a radius of about 1200km, P waves passing through the inner core have appreciably faster velocities than those that penetrate the outer core, the apparent increase in elasticity of the inner core is evidence that the inner core is solid.
