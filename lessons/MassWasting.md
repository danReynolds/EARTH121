# Mass Wasting

Landslides are examples of a basic geologic process called **mass wasting**, the downslope movement of rock, regolith and soil.

It is distinct from erosional processes examined in subsequent chapters because mass wasting does not require a transporting medium, like water wind or glacial ice.

## Role of Mass Wasting

The combined effect of mass wasting and running water produce stream valleys, the most common of Earth's landforms.

The reason stream valleys are wider than they are deep is because of mass wasting processes that transfer debris down into the valley.

If mass wasting is to occur, it needs slopes down which rock, soil and regolith can move. Most mass wasting events occur near young mountains.

Massive destructive landslides occur and over time, steep and rugged mountains are worn down to from gentler, more subdued terrain with smaller, less dramatic downslope movements.

Processes weaken slope material until the point that a trigger occurs for downslope movement.

## Mass Wasting Triggers:

1. Water

Mass wasting is sometimes triggered when heavy rains or periods of snowmelt saturate surface materials. When the pores in sediment become filled with water, the cohesion among particles is destroyed, allowing them to slide past one another with relative ease.

Moist sand is adhesive, but given enough water, the saturated particles will flow apart easily.

When clay is wetted, it becomes very slick and acts as a lubricating agent. Water also adds wait to the material, which may be enough to cause the material to slide or flow downslope.

2. Oversteepened Slopes

Unconsolidated granular particles form a stable slope called the **angle of repose**, which is the steepest angle at which material remains stable. Depending on the size and shape of the particles, and the water content of the material, the angle varies from 25 to 40 degrees.

Oversteepening produces unstable slopes. The response will not be immediate, as with loose, granular material, but eventually one or more mass wasting processes will eliminate the oversteepening and restore stability to the slope.

3. Removal of Vegetation

Plants contribute to the stability of slopes because their root systems bind soil and regolith together and hold water.

When plants are not present, mass wasting is increased.

4. Earthquakes

for obvious reasons.

5. Liquefaction

Intense ground shaking during earthquakes can cause water-saturated surface materials to lose strength and behave like fluid-like masses.

These masses are more likely to become mass wastes eve at lower angles of repose.

## Classification of Mass Wasting Processes

### Type of Motion

The kind of motion is described as a fall, slide or flow.

1. Fall: when the movement of particles is dropping through the air directly.

2. Slide: material moves along a curved surface or failure, but remains fairly held together, little internal deformation.

3. Flow: occurs when material moves downslope as a viscous fluid. Most flows are saturated with water.

## Type of Material

If soil and regolith are the descending mass, call it debris.

When a mass of mainly bedrock breaks loose and moves downslope, call it rock.

**Talus** = slope built of angular rock fragments.

## Slump

downward sliding of a mass of rock rotating as a unit along a curved surface. Slumped material does not travel fast or far. This form of mass wasting is common along river valleys and eroding shorelines.

Ruptured surface is spoon-shaped. Concave upward and outward. A crescent-shaped scarp is created at the head. Slumping often occurs because of oversteepening.

## Rock Slide

Occur when blocks of mainly bedrock break loose and travel rapidly down a slope.

Sometimes the rock slide is triggered when rain or melting snow destabilizes the underlying surface to the point where friction is no longer sufficient to hold the rock unit in place.

## Debris Flow

Rapid type of mass wasting that involves a flow of soil and **regolith**, the dust soil and broken rock ontop of rock, containing a large amount of water.

Debris flows are characteristic of mountain regions. Because of their fluid properties, debris flows frequently follow canyons and stream channels.

## Lahars

Debris flows composed mostly of volcanic material on the flanks of volcanoes are called lahars. They are deadly and occur at any time on a volcano.

When highly unstable ash and debris become saturated with water, it flows down the steep volcanic slopes, generally following existing stream channels.

Rainfall, ice-melt are a couple of the things that contribute to lahars.

## Earthflow

Slow, viscous earthflows most commonly form on hillsides in humid areas during times of heavy precipitation or snowmelt.

Material may slump, leaving a scarp on the upper part of a slope but rendering the material lower down on the slope unsupported and prone to viscous flow.

Materials involved are rich in silt and clay.

Earthflows range in size from bodies a few metres long to a kilometre long, very wide and up to 10 metres deep.

## Slow Movements

## Creep

Creep is a type of mass wasting that involves the gradual downhill movement of soil and regolith. One factor that contributes to creep is the alternate expansion and contraction of surface material caused by freezing and thawing or wetting and drying.

Creep moves very slowly, shifting particles to a slightly lower level. Creep is aided by anything that disturbs the soil, such as raindrop impact, plant roots, water saturation.

Process cannot be observed in action.

Trees get tilted but continue to grow upward, resulting in J-shaped trunks.

## Solifluction

When soil is saturated with water, the soggy mass may flow downslope at a rate of a few millimetres or centimetres per day or year.

This process means soil flow, and is common in regions underlain by permafrost. Solifluction occurs in the zone above the permafrost called the active layer, which thaws during the high-latitude summer and then refreezes in the winter.

During the summer season, water is unable to percolate into the permafrost layer below. The active layer then becomes saturated and flows.

## Other Periglacial Features

Processes related to permafrost and resulting features like solifluction lobes are called periglacial. Periglacial process often initiate mass wasting events in cold environments.
