# Geologic Time

In the late eighteenth century, James Hutton recognized the importance of time as a component in all geologic processes.

Earth had experienced many episodes of mountain building and erosion, which must have required great spans of geologic time.

## Relative Dating

During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, attempts were made to determine Earth's age. What scientists were seeking was a **numeric date**. Such dates specify the actual number of years that have passed since an event occurred.

Today radioactivity allows us to accurately determine numeric dates for rocks that represent important events in Earth's distant past.

**Relative dating** means that rocks are placed in their proper *sequence of formation*, regardless of how long ago something took place, we know the correct order.

## Law of Superposition

Nicolaus Steno came up with the law, stating that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, each bed is older than the one above and younger than the one below.

## Principle of Original Horizontality

Means that the layers of sediment are generally deposited in a horizontal position. If we observe rock layers that are flat, it means they have not been disturbed and still have their original horizontality.

If the layers are folded or inclined at a steep angle, they must have been moved into that position by crustal disturbances some time after their deposition.

## Principle of Cross-Cutting Relations

When a fault cuts through other rocks, or when magma intrudes and crystallizes, we can assume that the fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks affected.

The faults and dykes must have occurred after the sedimentary layers were deposited.

This is the principle of **cross-cutting relations**. By applying the cross-cutting principle, you can see that fault A occurred after the sandstone layer was deposited, etc.

Fault A could also have occurred before the conglomerate was laid down, because that layer is unbroken.

We can also state that dyke B and its associated sill are older than dyke A because dyke A cuts the sill.

We know that the batholith was emplaced after movement occurred along fault B but before dyke B was formed. This is true because the batholith cuts across fault B, while dyke B cuts across the batholith.

## Inclusions

Sometimes inclusions can aid the relative dating process. **Inclusions** are fragments of one rock unit that have been enclosed within another. The basic principle is logical and straightforward.

The rock mass adjacent to the one containing the inclusions must have been there first to provide the rock fragments.

Therefore, the rock mass containing inclusions is the younger of the two. The inclusions of intrusive igneous rock in the adjacent sedimentary layer indicate that the sedimentary layer was deposited on top of a weathered igneous mass rather than being intruded from below by magma later crystallized.

## Unconformities

When we observe layers of rock that have been deposited essentially without interruption, we call them **conformable**. Particular sites exhibit conformable beds representing certain spans of geologic time.

Throughout Earth history, the deposition of sediment has been interrupted over and over again. All such breaks in the rock record are termed unconformities.

An **unconformity** is a gap in the record produced by erosion and/or non-deposition. In the former case, uplift and erosion are followed by subsidence and renewed sedimentation. Unconformities are important features because they represent significant geologic events in Earth history.

Their recognition helps us identify what intervals of time are not represented by strata and are therefore missing from geologic record.

The rocks exposed in the Grand Canyon represent a large amount of geologic history, but the record is not continuous. Unconformities represent vast amounts of time that have not been recorded in the canyon's layers.

## Angular unconformity

The most easily recognized unconformity is an angular unconformity. It consists of tilted or folded sedimentary rocks that are overlain by younger, more flat-lying strata.

An angular unconformity indicates that during the pause in deposition, a period of deformation and erosion occurred.

## Disconformity

When contrasted with angular unconformities, disconformities are more common but usually far less conspicuous because the strata on either side are essentially parallel.

Many disconformities are difficult to identify because the rocks above and below are similar and they show little evidence of erosion. A break commonly resembles an ordinary bedding plane but can represent a significant gap in the rock record.

## Nonconformity

The third basic type of unconformity is nonconformity. Here the break separates older metamorphic or intrusive igneous rocks from younger sedimentary rocks. Just as angular unconformities and disconformities imply crustal movement, so do nonconformities.

## Correlation of Rock layers

To develop a geologic time scale that is applicable to the entire Earth, rocks of similar age in different regions must be matched up. This task is called correlation.

## Correlation by Physical Criteria

Within a limited area, correlating rocks of one locality with those of another can be done simply by walking along the outcrop.

By correlating the rocks from one place to another, a more comprehensive view of the geologic history of a region is possible.

## Fossils and Correlation

An English engineer and canal builder, William Smith, discovered that each rock formation in the canals he worked on contained fossils unlike those in the beds either above or below.

He noted that sedimentary strata in widely separated areas could be identified and correlated by their distinctive fossil content. Based on Smith's and others' classic observations, one of the most important and basic principles in historical geology was formulated:

> Fossil organisms succeed one another in a definite and determinable order, and therefore any time interval can be recognized by its fossil content.

This has come to be known as the **principle of fossil succession**. When you arrange fossils according to age, they document the evolution of life through time.

We can recognize an Age of Fishes->Age of Coal Swamps->Age of Reptiles->Age of Mammals

When fossils were found to be time indicators, they became the most useful means of correlating rocks of similar age in different regions, especially **index fossils**.

These fossils are widespread geographically and are limited to a short span of geologic time, so their presence provides an important method of matching rocks of the same age.

However, rock formations do not always contain a specific index fossil. In such situations, groups of fossils are used to establish the age of the bed.

Fossils are also important environmental indicators. Although much can be deduced about past environments from characteristics of sedimentary rocks, a close examination of their fossils can provide more information.

For example, when the remains of certain clam shells are found in limestone, the geologist assumes that the region was once covered by a shallow sea. Also, by using what we know of living organisms, we can conclude that fossils animals with thick shells capable of withstanding pounding and surging waves inhabited shorelines.

Fossils can also be used to indicate the former temperature of the water. Certain kinds of present day corals must live in warm and shallow tropical seas, like those around Florida and the Bahamas.

When similar types of corals are found in ancient limestone they indicate the marine environment that must have existed when they were alive. All these illustrate how fossils can help unravel the complex story of Earth's history.

## Dating with radioactivity

It is also possible to obtain reliable numeric dates for events in the geologic past. In some isotopes, the nuclei are unstable because the forces binding protons and neutrons together are not strong enough. The nuclei of such isotopes spontaneously break apart and emit energy, resulting in radioactivity.

An unstable radioactive isotope is the parent, and the isotopes resulting from the decay of the parent are the daughter products.

Radioactivity can provide a reliable means of calculating the ages of rocks and minerals that contain particular radioactive isotopes.

The procedure is called **radiometric dating**. Radiometric dating is reliable because the rates of decay for many isotopes have been precisely measured and do not vary under the physical conditions that exist in the crust.

Each radioactive isotope used for dating has been decaying at a fixed rate since the formation of the rocks in which it occurs and the products of decay have been accumulating at a corresponding rate.

When uranium crystallizes from magma, there is virtually no lead, the stable daughter product, from the previous decay. The radiometric clock starts.

## Half-Life

The time required for half of the nuclei in a sample to decay is called the **half-life** of the isotope. Half-life is a common way of expressing the rate of radio-active disintegration.

The half-life is when the ratio of the parent to the daughter material is 1:1 so, the parent has decayed by half. By the second half-life, the ratio is 1:3, so the original material is a quarter what is was originally and so on.

## Radiometric Dating

Of the many radioactive isotopes that exist in nature, five have proved particularly useful in providing radiometric ages for ancient rocks. Rubidium-87, thorium-232 and the two isotopes of uranium are used only for dating rocks that are millions of years old, but potassium-40 is more versatile.

## Sources of Error

It is important to realize that an accurate radiometric date can be obtained only if the mineral remained a closed system during the entire period since it formed. This means that there was neither the addition or loss of parent or daughter isotopes from mineral, which is not always the case.

In fact, an important limitation of the potassium-argon method arises from the fact that argon is a gas and it can leak from minerals.

For other radiometric clocks, a loss of daughter atoms can occur if the rock has been subjected to weathering or leaching.

To avoid this problem, one simple safeguard is to use only fresh, un-weathered material and not samples that may have been chemically altered.

## Dating with Carbon-14

For recent events, radioactive carbon-14 is used in **radiocarbon dating**. The half-life of carbon-14 is only 5730 years, so it can be used for dating events from recorded history and to about 50000 years.

## Geologic Time

Geologists have divided the whole of geologic history into units of various magnitudes. Together, they compose the **geologic time scale**, of Earth history. The major units of the time scale were delineated during the nineteenth century, principally by workers in Western Europe and Great Britain.

Because radiometric dating was unavailable at that time, the entire time scale was created by using methods of relative dating. It was only in the twentieth century that radiometric methods permitted numeric dates to be added.

## Structure of the Time Scale

The geologic time scale subdivides the history of Earth into many different units and provides a meaningful time frame within which the events of the geologic past are arranged.

**Eons** represent the greatest expanses of time. The eon that began 541 million years ago is the **Phanerozoic**, a term derived from Greek words meaning *visible life*.

This is a good description because the rocks and deposits of the Phanerozoic eon contain many fossils that document major evolutionary trends.

The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into **eras**. The three eras are:

* **Precambrian**:
  The time between the birth of the planet and the appearance of skeletonized forms of life. About 88% of Earth's history is estimated 4.6 billion years fall into this span.
* **Paleozoic**: six periods:
  * **Permian Period**: Named after the province of Perm, Russia, where these rocks were first studied.
  * **Carboniferous Period**: The literal meaning of this term is carbon-bearing, and refers tot he extensive coal measures of Western Europe from this age.
  * **Devonian Period**: Named after Devonshire, where rocks first studied
  * **Silurian Period**: Named after Celtic tribes
  * **Ordovician Period**: Wales during the Roman Conquest
  * **Cambrian Period**: Taken from Roman name for Wales, where rocks containing the earliest evidence of complex forms of life were first studied.
* **Mesozoic**: three periods:
  * **Cretaceous Period**: Derived from Greek word for chalk and first applied to extensive deposits that form white cliffs along the English channel. Extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of this period.
  * **Jurassic Period**: Named for the Jura mountains, located between France and Switzerland, where rocks of this age were first studied, age of dinosaurs.
  * **Triassic Period**: Taken from the word trias, in recognition of the threefold character of these rocks in Europe. Dinosaurs first appeared.
* **Cenozoic (Age of recent life)**:
  * **Quarternary Period**: From the latin work relating to the number four, remnant of a much older time scale.
  * **Neogene Period**: From the Greek words neo, new, and genes, born.
  * **Paleogene Period**: From the Greek words palaios, ancient, and genes, born.

Each era is subdivided into time units called **periods**. Each of these periods is characterized by a somewhat less profound change in life forms as compared with the eras.

Each period is divided into smaller units called **epochs**.

## Precambrian Time

The detail of geological time scale does not begin until about 541 million years ago, the date for the beginning of the Cambrian Period.

The nearly 4 billion years before the Cambrian are divided into 3 eons:

* **Hadean**: Hades
* **Archean**: Ancient
* **Proterozoic**: Before life

It is also common for this vast expanse of time to simply be referred to as the **Precambrian**.

Other reasons help explain our lack of detailed time scale for this vast segment of Earth history:

1. The first abundant fossil evidence does not appear in the geologic record until the beginning of the Cambrian Period. Before the Cambrian, simple life forms such as algae, bacteria pre-dominated.

Only meager Pre-Cambrian fossil records exist. Many exposures of Precambrian rocks have been studied in some detail, but correlation is often difficult because fossils are lacking.

2. Because Precambrian rocks are very old, most have been subjected to many changes. Much of the rock is highly distorted metamorphic rock. This makes interpretation of past environments difficult, because many of the clues in the original sedimentary rock have been destroyed.

Radiometric dating has provided a partial solution, but untangling the complex Precambrian record still remains difficult.

## Difficulties in Dating the Geologic Time Scale

Although reasonably accurate numeric dates have been worked out for the periods of the geologic time scale, this is hard and the main reason is that not all rocks can be dated by radiometric methods.

For radiometric dating to be useful, all minerals in the rock must have formed at about the same time.

Samples of sedimentary rock can only rarely be dated directly by radiometric means.

A detrital sedimentary rock may have particles of isotopes, but that doesn't help because sediments have been weathered from rocks of all ages.

To date sedimentary rocks, the strata are commonly related to datable igneous masses. This shows the necessity of combining laboratory dating methods with field observation.

Radiometric dates obtained from metamorphic rocks can be difficult to determine also, because the age of a particular mineral in a metamorphic rock does not have to represent the time when the rock initially formed. Instead, the date might indicate any one of a number of subsequent metamorphic phases in which the clock might have been reset.
