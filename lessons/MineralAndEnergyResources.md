# Mineral and Energy Resources

> If it can't be grown, it's gotta be mined.

Canada is one of the world's largest exporters of minerals and mineral products. At least 80% of the country's mineral and metal production is exported.

The number of different **mineral resources** required by modern industries is large and no nation is self-sufficient.

## Renewable and Non-renewable Resources

Resources are the endowment of materials held in reserve that are useful to people and are ultimately available commercially.

Resources are commonly divided into two broad categories: renewable and non-renewable.

* **Renewable resources** can be replenished fast enough for sustainable extraction.

Common examples are plants and animals for food, trees, and paper. Energy flowing from water, wind, and the Sun are also renewable.

* **Non-renewable** resources continue to be formed in Earth, but the processes that create them are so slow that significant deposits may take time much longer than is viable for sustainable human extraction.

Coal, oil, natural gas, when the present supplies have been mined, there will be no more for a very long time. Some non-renewable resources like minerals like aluminum, can actually be used over and over again, but others like coal are only used once.

Resources include **reserves**, the already identified deposits from which minerals and fuel materials can be extracted profitably and **known deposits** that are not yet economically or technologically recoverable.

They can also include deposits that have not been discovered but are inferred to exist.

## Metallic Mineral Deposits and Geologic Processes

Minerals we need are not distributed evenly. There are limited localities on Earth where the mining of particular materials is practical.

**Ore** is used to denote useful metallic minerals, and a few non-metallic minerals such as fluorite and sulphur where the mining of these minerals is profitable.

A rock body can be considered an ore at one time, and then not one later depending on economic value.

But some valuable minerals, most often those used for buildings, abrasives, ceramics and fertilizers are also not called ores, and are rather called **industrial minerals**.

## Magmatic Deposits

Many of the world's most valuable metallic mineral resources are directly associated with magma that ultimately forms igneous rocks. Certain metals are naturally enriched in certain magmas, but most only reach economically viable concentrations on further enrichment during the cooling process.

### Gravitational Settling

The igneous processes that generate some metal deposits are fairly straightforward. For example, some economically important minerals are concentrated by simple gravitational settling within a magma chamber.

Crystals of heavy minerals that form during early stages of crystallization settle at the bottom of a magmatic body, such as a batholith or sill, concentrating layers of minerals. Such deposits, called *cumulate* deposits, are important sources for chrome, iron, and platinum, forming from mafic intrusions.

### Immiscibility

Some metal deposits are probably produced by the separation of liquid components of magma in a similar manner to the separation of oil and water in salad dressing.

Such non-mixing of liquid phases is called **immiscibility**

Mantle-sourced magmas of ultramafic composition are naturally enriched in elements, such as nickel and copper.

### Pegmatites

As an igneous body cools, the most abundant components of the magma that are able to crystallize are removed from the magma. The melt remaining during the very last stages of cooling become enriched in volatile components and rare elements that are not readily incorporated into common igneous materials.

Minerals that crystallize from such a melt may have unusual chemical compositions, containing some of the least abundant elements found in Earth's crust.

Because the melt is very fluid, it is readily injected into cracks surrounding the cooling igneous body and allows the growth of large crystals.

The resulting rocks are called pegmatites and typically occur in dykes and small veins within plutons.

## Hydrothermal Deposits

Among the best-known and most important ore deposits are those generated from **hydrothermal (hot water) solutions**, which may be produced during the late-stage cooling of magma by the heating of groundwater or seawater, or by metamorphic processes.

Whereas metals are effectively insoluble in pure water, salt-rich brines are capable of dissolving at least small amounts of metallic elements.

High temperatures further increase the ability of brines to hold metals in solution.

## Hydrothermal Deposits Associated with Igneous Activity

Migrating hot waters can remove metallic ions from intrusive igneous rocks and carry them upward, where they may be deposited as an orebody.

The role of igneous activity in producing ore deposits is also evident in the depths of the oceans.

Heated seawater, rich in dissolved metals and sulphur gushes from the sea floor as particle-filled clouds called *black smokers*.

Seawater infiltrates the hot oceanic crust along the flanks of the ridge.

The water moves through this material and interacts with the basalt, extracting the sulphur, iron, copper and other metals.

Near the ridge axis, the hot metal-rich fluid rises along faults. On reaching the sea floor, the spewing liquid mixes with the cold seawater and sulphides precipitate to form massive sulphide deposits.

### Vein Deposits

Hydrothermal fluids generated by cooling magmas can rise to the surface through fractures, faults and other features that result from brittle deformation of overlying rock.

Fluids passing through the fractures eventually cool, allowing minerals to precipitate. The precipitated minerals fill the fractures to produce veins that can range in width from cm to m.

The fluids also react with the rocks immediately adjacent to the fractures to produce new minerals.

Mineral deposits that occur in veins, or at least are intimately associated with vein systems are called **vein deposits**.

Important sources of gold, silver, as well as copper and zinc.

### Disseminated Deposits

**Disseminated deposits** are another important type of accumulation generated by magma-sourced hydrothermal fluids. Rather than being concentrated in well-defined veins, these ores are distributed in small masses through a large rock body.

### Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposits

Some hydrothermal deposits form pod-shaped bodies of *massive sulphides* that are almost entirely composed of interlocking sulphide minerals that are associated with mafic rock. These are called **volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits (VMS)**.

The hydrothermal systems associated with the black smokers in mid ocean ridges are considered to be similar to those that produced VMS deposits in ancient rock.

The convective fluid flow that develops in sea-floor spreading leaches metals from oceanic crust, transports them through fractures and deposits them as sulphide minerals in mounds that surround volcanic vents. VMS deposits are these large sulphide bodies.

VMS deposits are very important because they contain economically valuable concentrations of copper, zinc, lead, silver, and gold.

## Sediment-Assocaited Hydrothermal Deposits

Some mineral deposits are associated with sedimentary rock and appear to have involved mineral precipitation from hydrothermal fluids at relatively low temperatures.

For most of these deposits, the source of the metals is the brine that was flushed from sediments buried deep in the sedimentary pile of a sedimentary basin, although deep-seated igneous activity may be responsible for contributing heat to the hydrothermal system.

### Sedimentary Exhalative (SEDEX) Deposits

Some mineral deposits feature thin layers of massive sulphide that are interbedded with detrital or chemical sedimentary rocks.

These deposits are called *sedimentary exhalative, SEDEX* deposits as they are not only related to sedimentary strata, but also thought to be associated with the mineral precipitation from fluids that were *exhaled* from hydrothermal vents onto the seafloor.

SEDEX deposits typically form sheet to lens like bodies that are vertically stacked within the sediment fill of a failed continental drifts.

### Sediment-Hosted Stratiform Deposits

Uncertain origin, strata-like bodies of metallic minerals which occur within sedimentary units of ancient rift basins.

Ore minerals occur as pore-filling material of the host rock.

## Sedimentary Deposits

A peculiar sedimentary rock called **banded iron formation** was formed during the Archean and Proterozoic eons.

The formation of **placer deposits** relates to the sorting action of running water.

Large, heavy sediment grains tend to be deposited in more agitated water than do smaller, lighter ones.

Mineral particles of high density an be concentrated because of the sorting out and washing away of mineral particles of lower density.

The concentrations of heavy minerals that form in this manner are called placers and are associated with areas of high water agitation, such as streams or beaches.

Placer deposits of gold were the foundation of the famous gold rushes and it is in placer deposits that *nuggets* of gold are found.

## Metamorphic Deposits

The role of metamorphism in producing mineral deposits is tied to igneous processes.

Many of the most important metamorphic ore deposits are produced by contact metamorphism.

The host rock is re-crystallized and chemically altered by heat, pressure and hydrothermal solutions emanating from an intruding igneous body.

The extent to which the host rock is altered depends on the nature of the intruding igneous mass as well as the nature of the host rock.

The hydrothermal ore deposits may be disseminated through the altered zone or concentrated as masses either next to the intrusive body or along the margins of the metamorphic zone.

## Weathering Deposits

Weathering creates many important mineral deposits by concentrating minor amounts of metals that are scattered through unweathered rock into economically valuable reserves.

This transformation is termed **secondary enrichment** and takes place in one of two ways:

1. Chemical weathering coupled with downward-percolating water removes undesirable materials from decomposing rocks, leaving the desirable elements enriched in the upper zones of the soil.

2. The reverse, the desirable elements are removed and carrier to lower zones where they are redeposited and higher concentrated.

### Bauxite

The principle ore of aluminum, is one example of ore created by enrichment through weathering.

Aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust, but most is tied up in silicate materials from which it is difficult to extract.

Bauxite forms in wet tropical climates deeply weathered in soils called laterites. When subjected to intense and prolonged tropical chemical weathering, other minerals leave, and the insoluble bauxite becomes concentrated.

## Non-metallic Mineral Resources

People often do not realize the importance of non-metallic minerals because they see only the products that result from their use, not the minerals themselves.

Many non-metallics are used up in the process of creating other products.

Fluorite and Limestone and used for Steel, etc.

Non-metallic mineral resources are divided into two broad groups:

* Aggregate and Stone
* Industrial Minerals

## Aggregate and Stone

Most building materials are widely distributed and present in large quantities, with little value.

The aggregate and stone industry is very important in the lives of Canadians, as reflected in the thousands of sand and gravel pits and stone quarries in the country.

Natural aggregate consists of crushed stone, sand and gravel. From the standpoint of quantity and value, aggregate is a very important building material.

Aggregate is used as-is in various construction applications.

## Industrial Minerals

Many non-metalic resources are classified as industrial minerals. In some instances, these materials are important because they contain specific chemical elements or compounds used in fertilizers or industrial chemicals.

Some minerals possess useful physical properties. For example, garnet is both relatively hard and common, making it a handy substance for the manufacture of abrasive products.

Other industrial minerals are used in the manufacture of products used in construction as fillers, coaters, and extenders in plastics, paints and paper products and as heat-resistant materials.

**Diamonds** are extremely valuable as an abrasive by virtue of being the hardest natural substance known. Only about one quarter of all diamonds mined are used as gemstones.

The majority of diamonds are found in a unique ultramafic igneous rock called **kimberlite**.

Magmas that produce kimberlite are believed to be generated by a small amount of partial melting in the asthenosphere at depths nearly 200 kilometres below the Earth's surface.

The diamonds themselves do not crystallize from kimberlitic magma, rather they are produced in the deep roots of the solid, lithospheric mantle beneath areas of old, stable continental crust at depths of more than 120 kilometres.

It is only here that high temperatures and pressures remain stable for geologically long enough periods of time to allow the formation of diamonds.

Kimberlitic magma rises rapidly to the surface, acting as a sort of geologic elevator that picks up chunks of lithosphere mantle material and crustal rock during its ascent.

If kimberlitic magma passes through the deep areas of lithospheric mantle where diamonds reside, diamonds can be naturally sampled from this material as xenocrysts and as crystal components of xenoliths to be carried upwards by the magma.

During the last stage of magma ascent, the rapid escape of carbon dioxide from the magma and the interaction of the hot kimberlitic magma with groundwater results in an explosive volcanic eruption from a pipe-shaped vent. The fractures and cavities within the vent are filled with kimberlite and shattered fragments of the surrounding rock.

### Clays

The diverse, physical and chemical properties of clays make them extremely useful in many applications.

### Carbonate Minerals

Calcium carbonate in the form of calcite is an important component of many sedimentary rocks.

Vast quantities of limestone are quarried worldwide.

Although some limestone is quarried raw in the form of building stone, a great deal of it is extracted for its calcium carbonate content.

Large volumes of limestone are quarried and processed for the manufacture of cement.

It is also used in asphalt, fertilizers, paints, etc.

### Evaporite Salts

Evaporite deposits are important sources of many industrial minerals, particularly chloride and sulphate salts and some carbonate minerals.

During many times in Earth's past, widespread evaporite deposits were formed in shallow basins that were periodically flooded by seawater but dried up because of intense evaporation under arid conditions.

 ## Non-renewable Energy Resources

 ### Petroleum

 Petroleum includes oil and gas and ins presently a vital resource for our daily activities.

 It is mainly used as fuel, but it also composes the main ingredients in plastics that find their way into synthetic fabrics, product packaging, etc.

 ## How Petroleum is formed

The origin of petroleum lines in organic matter contained in the tissues of living things.

Organic matter has a low preservation potential in aquatic environments, but in quiet waters with low-oxygen conditions, organic-rich sediments like shales and fine-grained carbonate rock prevail.

These organic rich rocks like shale are the *principal sources* of organic matter from which petroleum is generated.

While organic matter stands a better chance of survival under low-oxygen conditions, it is not immune to microbial attacks.

As the rich organic matter of a source rock is heated, it is transformed into a solid waxy substance called *kerogen*.

Oil generation peaks at temperatures of about 100C. The natural gas produced at temperatures just above that of peak oil generation is called **wet gas**, because it contains gaseous components like ethane, propane and butane.

At higher temperatures of 150C, only **dry gas** exists, consisting almost entirely of methane.

Whereas organic matter from marine sources is *oil prone*, land-derived organic matter tends to be more *gas prone*.

## Petroleum Migration

Unlike the organic matter from which they form, oil and gas are mobile. These fluids migrate into adjacent rocks of higher permeability.

The rock layers containing the oil and gas are saturated with water and since oil and gas are less dense, they migrate upward through the water-filled pore spaces of the enclosing rock. Unless something halts this migration, they eventually reach the surface.

## Petroleum Traps

Sometimes the upward migration of oil and gas is halted. A geologic environment that enables economically significant amounts of oil and gas to accumulate underground is called a **petroleum trap**.

All such traps have two common conditions:

1. A porous, permeable **reservoir rock** that will yield oil and natural gas in sufficient quantities to make driling worthwhile.

2. **Cap rock** such as shale that is virtually impermeable to oil and gas.

The cap rock halts the upwardly mobile oil and gas and keeps them from escaping to the surface. Petroleum traps can be produced in a number of ways, but they can be separated into two groups:

* **Structural Traps**: Petroleum traps that form because of the structural deformation of the rock layer that contains hydrocarbons.

An anticline is an up-arched succession of sedimentary strata that collects the oil and gas at the top of the fold.

* **Stratigraphic Traps**: are petroleum traps that are formed because of lateral and vertical changes in rock type that reflects patterns of sediment deposition. A common type of stratigraphic trap is a pinch-out trap.

The tapering off of a reservoir unit into a body of impermeable rock is an example of a stratigraphic pinch-out trap.

An unconformity trap results from the truncation of a reservoir unit by erosion, followed by deposition of impermeable cap rock sediments.

## Coal

Whereas petroleum is generally sourced from organic matter provided by aquatic plankton, coal is largely derived from fibrous, woody remains of land plants.

The organic remains that form coal can only accumulate enough in oxygen-poor environments.

Accordingly, accumulations of coal-forming organic matter tend to be restricted to swamps.

In a swamp, the decomposition of organic matter consumes all the oxygen, the remaining matter that survives decomposition is buried to progressively greater depths, where it is gradually cooked and compressed to form coal.

Surface coal mining can be destructive to the local environment, while underground mining has terrible effects on human life and health.

Air pollution is also another problem with the burning of coal because of the sulphur content.

## Fossil Fuels in Canada

Through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic time, organic-rich sediments and seas occupied areas of Canada.

## Environmental Effects of Fossil Fuel use

### Air pollution

The human population constitutes a giant chemical factory producing a remarkable variety of undesirable products.

Primary pollutants are emitted directly from identifiable sources, polluting the air immediately.

When chemical reactions take place among primary pollutants, *secondary pollutants* are formed. The noxious mixture of gases and particles that make up urban smog is an important example that is created when volatile organic compounds and suplhur and nitrogen oxides react in the presence of sunlight.

The burning of fossil fuels by industry and various modes of transpiration are the greatest contributors of these compounds.

### Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming

The connection between global warming and burning of fossil fuels relates to a basic product of combustion: Carbon dioxide.

Carbon dioxide occurs naturally in the atmosphere and is augmented by fuel combustion.

It is transparent to incoming short-wave solar radiation but is not transparent to some of the longer wavelength outgoing radiation emitted by Earth.

Energy leaving the Earth is trapped by carbon dioxide, in the process commonly known as the *greenhouse effect*.

## Unconventional Fossil Fuel Deposits

As supplies of petroleum and coal decrease, there is an increasing reliance on unconventional methods of extraction.

1. **Heavy Oil Sands**: Also called tar sands, are mixtures of sediment, water and abundant black, tar-like bitumen. Cool, oxygen-rich groundwater provided optimal conditions for certain bacteria to consume parts of oil, leaving behind a heavy residue of degraded oil.

Because of viscosity, cannot pump them. Need to mine at surface and heat to mobilize. About half the energy as you get is used to get it.

2. **Oil Shale**: In some cases, fine-grained, organic-rich sediment rocks have not been subjected to sufficiently high temp to form liquid, but remain kerogen.

A fine-grained rock containing an abundance of kerogen is called an **oil shale**. Although widely used, this term is misleading because most oil shales are not shales at all but fine-grained limestones.

Are usually represented as fine-grained lake sediments. The extraction of a liquid product from oil shale would involve a high amount of energy because it must be mined and heated and is not yet profitable.

### Methane Hydrate

Found in permafrost areas associated with methane seeps. Sufficiently high in methane content to produce a flame when ignited.

The warming effect of methane in the atmosphere is 20x that of carbon dioxide and methane leaks are a big concern.

### Coal-Bed Methane and Shale gas

Coal-bed methane is trapped in the pore spaces of coal seams. Confined in the pores of sedimentary rocks and is difficult to extract by conventional means. But it is still being done in Canada.

Can be released by pumping large quantities of water from a coal seam through several wells. This is a concern because of groundwater contamination, depletion and atmospheric contamination by methane.

### Shale gas

Shale gas, primarily methane, remained trapped in the pores and fractures of shale or other fine-grained sedimentary rock.

This natural gas is produced when organic matter contained in the rock undergoes geothermal cracking or microbial degradation.

Due to the low permeability of the rock, not all of the hydrocarbons generated as the organic matter decayed could be expelled. Until fairly recently, the development of shale gas as a resource has been hampered by its low profit potential relative to conventional oil production.

To extract shale gas, the permeability of the rock must be enhanced by fracturing the rock with pressurized fluid, a process called **hydrofracturing** or **fracking**.

## Nuclear Energy

Nuclear power plants generate 12% of Canada's electricity. Splitting neutrons and all that.

### Candu Reactors

The production of nuclear power in Canada is centred on the CANDU design, which uses natural uranium-235 as fuel and deuterium oxide as a moderator and heat transport medium.

Deuterium is a stable isotope of hydrogen containing a proton and neutron. Deuterium oxide is heavier than hydrogen oxygen, and is called **heavy water**.

The CANDU designs allows for on-power refuelling, does not require fuel reprocessing and can use spent fuel from other reactors. The versatility of CANDU reactors is a major factor that has contributed to their use in a number of other countries as well.

### Uranium Occurrences

Although a metal, uranium is discussed as a fuel source. It is the only naturally occurring isotope that is readily fissionable and is therefore the primary fuel used in nuclear power plants.

Although most quantities of uranium ore have been discovered, most contain less than 0.05 percent uranium. In addition to scarcity, the size of the uranium atom prevents it from being incorporated into the crystal lattice of most rock-forming minerals.

It is also soluble in oxidizing environments and requires unusual conditions to be precipitated in minerals at Earth's surface. Uranium ores are extremely diverse in their geologic settings, but it appears that a critical factor controlling the precipitation of uranium-bearing minerals is the absence of oxygen.

Uranium can be enriched in residual fluids of felsic magmas, reaching concentrations over a hundred ppm.

### Obstacles to development

The cost of the facilities alone is a major obstacle to nuclear energy. The consequences of a nuclear leak is also a negative factor that hinders production.

Dangers arise from the possible escape of radioactive debris during a meltdown of the core or other malfunction.

Additional hazards like the disposal of nuclear waste and the relationships between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons are all obstacles to its development. Non-renewable because uranium deposits are finite.

## Renewable Fuel sources

### Geothermal Energy

Popular for home and commercial heating, including greenhouses and fish farms year-round.

Most geothermal energy used to generate electricity is focused on areas where groundwater is heated by volcanic activity.

In geothermal power plants, steam and superheated water generated by hot springs is piped to turbines that generate electric power. In Canada, the highest potential for generating electricity from geothermal energy on a large scale lies in BC and the Yukon where recent igneous activity has produced areas of high heat flow.

## Organic Based sources

### Landfill Methane

Methane produced by the microbial decomposition of organic matter in landfills is a significant greenhouse gas that escapes to the atmosphere. With continued rise in global pollution, methane production from landfills can only increase.

This methane could instead be used as fuel.

### Biomass Energy

Biomass energy is derived from the tissues of plants through photosynthesis.

Plants produce their structural tissues and sugars with solar energy and this stored energy can later be released through combustion.

Biomass fuel is a primary source of energy in developing countries in the form of wood and dung. A renewable biomass fuel is ethanol and in Canada, the forestry industry generates lots of waste material that could support large ethanol-production.

## Hydroelectric power

Hydroelectric power contributes to 58% of Canada's energy generation. Most of this is produced at large dams, which allow controlled flow of water.

Although water power is considered a renewable resource, the dams built to provide this power have a finite lifetime and are always negative environmental constructs. Eventually, sediment carried by upstream water will completely fill dam reservoirs.

A new strategy, called **pumped water-storage system**, is a type of energy management. When demand for electricity is low, unneeded power produced by non-hydroelectric sources is used to pump water from a lower reservoir to a storage area at a higher elevation. When demand for electricity is high, the water stored in the higher reservoir is available to drive turbines and produce electricity to supplement the power supply.

## Solar Energy

Solar energy has become popular as an alternative resource on a small scale. Government studies suggest that solar energy could provide 5% of Canada's electricity.

The Sarnia Power Plant covers nearly 420 Canadian football fields and uses 1.3 million thin film solar panels to generate enough electricity for 12000 homes.

## Wind Energy

Wind turbines are now commonplace in Canada, but they are controversial as noise pollution, land costs for turbine sites, and safety risks posed to wildlife have been raised.

## Tidal Power

The ocean contains a huge amount of physical energy in tides. The principle of electricity generation from tidal energy is simple. The most common method involves trapping ocean water in reservoirs at high tide and later releasing it through hydroelectric turbines as the tide goes out.

It is limited to areas where the tidal range is high and water turbidity is low.
